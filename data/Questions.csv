"1","11227809","","Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?","<p>Here is a piece of C++ code that shows some very peculiar behavior. For some strange reason, sorting the data (<em>before</em> the timed region) miraculously makes the loop almost six times faster.</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster.
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
    {
        for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        {   // Primary loop
            if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock()-start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; elapsedTime &lt;&lt; '\n';
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;sum = &quot; &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; '\n';
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Without <code>std::sort(data, data + arraySize);</code>, the code runs in 11.54 seconds.</li>
<li>With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Sorting itself takes more time than than this one pass over the array, so it's not actually worth doing if we needed to calculate this for an unknown array.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly, so I tried Java:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
        {
            for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            {   // Primary loop
                if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println(&quot;sum = &quot; + sum);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>With a similar but less extreme result.</p>
<hr />
<p>My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache"" rel=""noreferrer"">cache</a>, but then I thought how silly that was because the array was just generated.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is going on?</li>
<li>Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?</li>
</ul>
<p>The code is summing up some independent terms, so the order should not matter.</p>

directory = os.path.dirname(file_path)

try:

<p>This is a collection of questions that come up every now and then about syntax in PHP. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate in maintaining this list.</p>
<h3>Why is this?</h3>
<p>It used to be hard to find questions about operators and other syntax tokens.¹<br />
The main idea is to have links to existing questions on Stack Overflow, so it's easier for us to reference them, not to copy over content from the PHP Manual.</p>
<p>Note: Since January 2013, Stack Overflow <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/160100/a-new-search-engine-for-stack-exchange"">does support special characters</a>. Just surround the search terms by quotes, e.g. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Bphp%5D%20%22===%22%20vs%20%22==%22""><code>[php] &quot;==&quot; vs &quot;===&quot;</code></a></p>
<h3><strong>What should I do here?</strong></h3>
<p>If you have been pointed here by someone because you have asked such a question, please find the particular syntax below. The linked pages to the <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/index.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">PHP manual</a> along with the linked questions will likely answer your question then.

<p>Unlike many other programming languages, which are often picked up on the go from tutorials found on the Internet, few are able to quickly pick up C++ without studying a well-written C++ book. It is way too big and complex for doing this. In fact, it is so big and complex, that <em><strong>there are very many very bad C++ books</strong></em> out there. And we are not talking about bad style, but things like sporting <em>glaringly obvious factual errors</em> and <em>promoting abysmally bad programming styles</em>.</p>
<p>Please edit the accepted answer to provide <strong>quality books</strong> and an approximate skill level — <em>preferably</em> <strong>after</strong> <em>discussing your addition in <a href=""https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/10/loungec"">the C++ chat room</a></em>. (The regulars might mercilessly undo your work if they disagree with a recommendation.) Add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally read/benefited from. Feel free to debate quality, headings, etc. Books that meet the criteria will be added to the list.  Books that have reviews by the Association of C and C++ Users (ACCU) have links to the review.</p>

"1","14415881","","How can I pair socks from a pile efficiently?","<p>Yesterday I was pairing the socks from the clean laundry and figured out the way I was doing it is not very efficient. I was doing a naive search&nbsp;— picking one sock and ""iterating"" the pile in order to find its pair. This requires iterating over n/2 * n/4 = n<sup>2</sup>/8 socks on average.</p>

<p>As a computer scientist I was thinking what I could do? Sorting (according to size/color/...) of course came to mind to achieve an O(NlogN) solution.</p>

<p>Hashing or other not-in-place solutions are not an option, because I am not able to duplicate my socks (though it could be nice if I could).</p>

<p><strong>So, the question is basically:</strong></p>

<p>Given a pile of <code>n</code> pairs of socks, containing <code>2n</code> elements (assume each sock has exactly one matching pair), what is the best way to pair them up efficiently with up to logarithmic extra space? (I believe I can remember that amount of info if needed.)</p>

<p>I will appreciate an answer that addresses the following aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li>A general <em>theoretical</em> solution for a huge number of socks.</li>
<li>The actual number of socks is not that large, I don't believe my spouse and I have more than 30 pairs. (And it is fairly easy to distinguish between my socks and hers; can this be used as well?)</li>
<li>Is it equivalent to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_distinctness_problem"" rel=""noreferrer"">element distinctness problem</a>?</li>
