"29638","GalacticCowboy","","11446","","","<p>I was an early adopter of Stack Overflow, quite early in the beta period. I was active to various extents on several other sites, including reaching a level that granted various queue-management rights on seven of them. I have two-digit profile ids on several of these, and low 3-digits on others.</p>

<p>My activity has become increasingly infrequent over the past few years, for a variety of reasons both personal and with the platform. With the recent changes that have occurred both at the corporate and moderator levels, I do not see anything that would make this increase at this point or anytime soon. I may still be on from time to time, but my contributions will be rare to nonexistent. I don't see Stack Overflow / Stack Exchange to be a place that wants me, nor is it a place I particularly want to be most of the time.</p>

<p>For this reason, I've removed my profile information and a large portion of my community involvement. Thanks for 10 interesting, thought-provoking, and sometimes maddening years together. </p>

<p>I am a developer working in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/asp.net-mvc"">ASP.NET MVC</a> from the early CTPs through to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/asp.net-core"">ASP.NET Core</a>.</p>

<p>I work in both VB.NET and C#, but also write a lot of scripts in Powershell which I have become increasingly enamoured by due to some of the language features introduced in later versions.</p>

<p>I originally started professional software development using ASP.NET (webforms). I then switched jobs and worked almost exclusively in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/coldfusion"">ColdFusion</a>. It gave me the chance to get to know MVC a lot more through the <a href=""https://github.com/Mach-II/Mach-II-Framework"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mach-II</a> framework - an implementation of MVC for Coldfusion. When ASP.NET MVC came out, convinced our employers to migrate due to a wider availability of software engineers (it was incredibly difficult to get good ColdFusion developers!). When it came to picking up ASP.NET MVC, I felt I had a much stronger advantage than if I had continued using 'classic' ASP.NET webforms.</p>

<p>I answered more questions in the first two months on here, than I did in five years at <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=experts+exchange+scam"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Experts Exchange</a>, and I enjoy the fact that stackoverflow is more community based.</p>

<p>Initially spurred on by the challenge of ""doing better than <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/261677/jonathon-bolster"">Jonathon Bolster</a>"", I found that helping out is extremely enjoyable and helping people of all technical skill levels is great fun.</p>

"18829","Alex Dupuy","","5714","","Berlin, Germany","<p>I have been involved in computers and networking for well over half my life -- I guess that makes me an old-timer. Not old enough to have used the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET#Software_and_protocols"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pre-Internet (NCP) ARPAnet</a>, but old enough to have used the ARPAnet and applied a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_tap"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vampire tap</a> to an original Ethernet cable. I love the new networking technologies, too: IPv6 and multicasting will both catch on someday (soon). My programming mind was permanently warped by learning <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SETL</a> at an early age (I was a senior in high school taking an intro CS course at NYU).</p>
<p>My interest in (natural) languages goes back even further; I have always loved learning languages and have tried my hand at more than a half-dozen of them (I am still competent in a few). The specific application of it to internationalization/localization grew out of my experience with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO-1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OLPC XO-1</a> computers I got for my daughter.</p>
<p>I have also developed an interest in online social communities and collaboration; not just the open source movement, but open data as well, which grew out of my participation in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MusicBrainz"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MusicBrainz</a> project. This has been informed by my informal anthropological experience as the life partner of an academic anthropologist and my participation in her fieldwork in Guatemala.</p>

"17688","Michael Johnson","","2197","https://redbeardcreations.com","Franklin, KS, United States","<p>I've been programming professionally since 1990, first in C, then C++, and now in PHP. I've been doing proprietary web app development in PHP full time since 2003. I've seen PEAR come and go, used Zend Framework 1.x, and am now using Composer to bring in the likes of Slim, Symfony, Aura, and whatever else is useful today. I'm pretty well versed with databases and SQL, specifically MySQL using InnoDB, although I'm considering switching to Amazon Aurora and/or Maria DB. I also have quite a bit of experience with Javascript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS for front-end work. I use Emacs almost exclusively for all my programming work.</p>

<p><p>A few years ago I started work on a legacy PHP project. I've spent the time slowing modernizing it. We've recently (2016) started a major round of UI updates, which will likely continue for some time. I'm actively creating an internal API that the new front end (written with jQuery and Telerik's Kendo UI) uses.<p></p>

<p>Previously I spent some time with C#, .NET, and WCF/RIA in a project that used Silverlight as the front end. Of course, as went Silverlight, so did the project.</p>

<p>I also have a smattering of design experience, having done most of the design work for several of our web apps. Our graphic artists make it pretty with graphics, but I do the design.</p>

<p>I recently started a blog (my listed website), which I intend to keep fairly programming related. I haven't blogged consistently yet, but I'd like to at some point.</p>

<p>Outside of programming, I dabble in music creation and 3D rendering. I've recently picked up a MIDI keyboard to help with the music and for the 3D stuff I love raytracing with POV-Ray, which you can see at my deviantArt account, linked from my website (on the About page).</p>

<p>After an unfortunate journey taking him through the restricted lands of Pacal, Delphi, VB, Java, C++, C#, he finally discovered Ruby.
</p><p>
Going from not knowing Ruby to knowing Ruby was for him a revelation of roughly the same order of magnitude as discovering programming. He discovered Git at about the same time he started working with Ruby professionally, and had the same kind of revelation for source control.
</p><p>
Needless to say, both tools are now the underpinnings of most of the things he undertakes programmatically.
</p><p>
Mathieu can be observed in the wild, sometimes going under the name of webmat. He will often be rambling (programblings.com) about programming, Git or working on open source projects.
</p><p>
He is the author of git_remote_branch, a tool that helps common mortals like him trivially manipulate branches published in shared repositories.

"4725","Tom Hawtin - tackline","","141311","","Edinburgh, Scotland","<h1>Code like <em>Kipling</em></h1>
<hr />
<p>Tom spent a decade dealing with fallout from global state and failed semantic integrity of objects. Please don't make him cry.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Why not try my <a href=""https://github.com/tackline/Little-Bean"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trivial &quot;IDE&quot; for single-file Java programs</a>?</strong></p>
<hr />
<h1>General Guidelines</h1>
<ul>
<li>Please obfuscate your code making it, at best, unobviously broken. Even if the code isn't important.</li>
<li>Global state has been a known bad idea for forty years. Please don't do it.</li>
<li>Corollary of either of the first two guidelines: Singletons are pure evil. Don't.</li>
<li>Please think about encapsulate. That implies not shoving getters and setters all over the place. Also prefer not use implementation inheritance and avoid protected. Generally limit unnecessary access and implied implementation, even on larger scales.</li>
<li>Please practice good dependency hygiene. Yeah it's not interesting, but turns out to be really important for a number of reasons.</li>
<li>If you're doing layers of security, please do check each layer individually.</li>
<li>Please don't give nulls a meaning. Throw an NPE.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Things that are wrong</h1>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Postel's Law&quot;. Good for UI, but for machine interface you wont catch errors and differences fixing mistakes allows TOCTOU-style vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. Increasing the number of reviewers decreases the depth each one expends on the problem. It's the maximum depth which is crucial unless the problem is trivial in which case who cares.</li>
<li>Vulnerabilities are the adversary's fault. Vulnerabilities are the fault of the party that decided to ship the faulty product.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Former work:</strong> Formerly a &quot;Vulnerability Engineer&quot; in the Java SE Security team for Oracle.</p>
<p><strong>Top advice:</strong> If I were you, I wouldn't be starting from here.</p>
<p><strong>Toast advice:</strong> Look after the corners and the middle will look after itself.</p>

I'm also into physics and astronomy, <a href=""http://last.fm/user/mattkantor"" rel=""nofollow"">music</a>, sociology, philosophy, and just about anything that I think might help me make sense of this crazy and beautiful world. Designing things and solving problems are ways of channeling my creative energy to shape a better future.</p>

<p>I grew up on <a href=""http://schocharieridge.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">a rural horse farm</a> in New Tripoli, PA. There still isn't cable on our street, the phone lines were so bad that we were lucky to get a 30K internet connection, and it took 45 minutes to traverse my old school district. We once found moonshine under our floorboards when remodeling a room.</p>

<p>I like fixing things; I enjoy the outdoors; I think that most people take themselves way too seriously. I derive a profound sense of spiritual fulfillment—though I'm not a religious man—from exploring the whys and whats of this world.</p>

<hr>

<p>Most of my professional career has involved web design &amp; development.</p>

<p>I enjoy building modular software with clean yet flexible APIs. When creating web services, I believe in building atop HTTP instead of kludging my way around it: I create RESTful systems that are truly part of the web in both spirit and practice.</p>

<p>I try to use open source software and follow open standards whenever practical.</p>

"2097","BlackShift","","2024","","Netherlands","<p>Voi use voi/void/voids/voids/voidself as pronouns. E.g. ""Voids answer is wrong. Lets correct it for void. Voi wouldn't mind."" Voi is uncomfortable with the gender-specific pronouns 'he' and 'she', not because voi dislikes voids gender assigned at birth, but because it is irrelevant noise and none of anyone's business.</p>

<p>Furthermore, people are less like individuals and more like elements of a collective, certainly users at StackExchange sites. The use of dualistic pronouns like 'I', 'we' and 'you' do not reflect the transcendental nature of this site (and society as a whole). Voi therefore prefer to use voi/void/voids/voids/voidself also for first and second person pronouns.</p>

<p>Please use voi/void/voids/voids/voidself when referring to void. Not everyone has the same worldview, so it is not offending to void if voi uses other pronouns when referring to voidself. Voi will use preferred pronouns when referring to others if known.</p>

My primary language is C# but I also have dabbled in Ruby and Python.  Currently working at a good company doing C# and SQL work with a little extras here and there.  I pride myself on software craftsmanship and am a big proponent of the SOLID principles and good software design.  My ultimate goal is to advance to a leadership role where I can focus on quality and delivering results that solve problems, empower users to be more efficient, and remain stable and easy to expand on later.</p>

<p><strong>Why Borland failed?</strong></p>
<p>The Borland Turbo languages where the Cat's Pajamas.<br />
Microsoft countered with the Quick languages.<br />
Borland made Turbo Pascal for Windows and with Objects and then made Delphi.<br />
Microsoft countered with Visual BASIC.<br />
Borland made Borland C++ and JBuilder.<br />
Microsoft countered with Visual C++ and Visual J++/J# and then later Visual C#.
The free IDEs and Free compiler languages ate into Borland's sales. Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ, BlueJ, Sublime Text, GNU C/C++, Apple XCode, FreePascal/Lazarus, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, Python, Code::Blocks, etc.<br />
In 2005 Microsoft introduce Visual Studio Express a free version of their development tools.
Like Amiga, Borland had the superior technology, but cheaper/free alternatives undercut their sales.
Mostly it was the free and open source revolution that did Borland in. orionblastar</p>

"122763","Mark E. Haase","","23818","https://markhaa.se","McLean, VA, United States","<p>Hi! I have been working full-time as a software engineer since I graduated from college in 2005. I began coding when I was 13, and I have loved it ever since. My main interest area is information security – or <em>cyber</em> if you prefer – and in addition to writing security software for a long time, I have also done some penetration testing work. In the last three years, I have been working as a contractor on a DARPA R&amp;D contract involving web crawling, dark web, and machine learning.</p>

<p>My main strength is developing web applications in high-level languages – Python is my favorite – but I consider myself more of a general hacker who is comfortable working with a wide range of technologies and learning whatever I need to accomplish the task at hand. (I suppose that <em>full-stack</em> is the trendy term.) In my study of infosec, I have spent a lot of time learning to read assembly and reverse engineer applications to develop exploits. (I have the OSCP, CISSP, and CEH certifications.)</p>

<p>I have released a couple of work projects as open source. I created an easy-to-use web crawler called <a href=""https://gitlab.com/hyperion-gray/starbelly"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Starbelly</a>, as well as a database migrations system called <a href=""https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/agnostic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Agnostic</a>. And if you want to get really nerdy with me, I wrote a tiny utility called <a href=""https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/sshadduser"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>sshadduser</code></a> that simplifies the error-prone process of giving somebody SSH access to a server. I also like writing and teaching. In addition to developing infosec courses for government clients, I also participate here on Stack Overflow and infrequently publish on <a href=""https://markhaa.se"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my tech blog</a>.</p>

<p>I have been working full-time remote for several years now out of my home office in the Washington DC area. I am seeking contract work (1099) for 2018.</p>

<p>Been cutting code for <em>well</em> over 40 years now (<em>way back to The Hobbit on the BBC Micro and Way Of The Exploding Fist on the C64! Who remembers those games now?</em>)... no sign of stopping yet.</p>
<p>I now use StackOverflow mainly to keep my brain active. I have found answering questions here has improved my jQuery skills more than anything else I have tried. My favorite, most time-consuming and <em>most underrated</em>, answer is here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6801546/silverlight-rotate-scale-a-bitmap-image-to-fit-within-rectangle-without-croppi/6802332#6802332"">Silverlight Rotate &amp; Scale a bitmap image to fit within rectangle without cropping</a> unfortunately my hosting company pulled the rug from that hosting so the interactive example is gone :(</p>
<p>Did a lot of Silverlight &amp; WPF PRISM work in recent years, then WP7 and Windows 8. Had jQuery jumping through hoops using TypeScript and LESS on highly structured and <em>very large</em> projects using dozens of my own jQuery plugins.</p>

<p>I have a lot of fun with browser oriented user interface toolkits like GWT,  EXT-JS, YUI, JQuery. More recently I've been building some fun vizualizations for large data sets using D3 and scalable vector graphics.</p>

<p>Server side, I have a long history (love,hate) with traditional relational databases such as SQL Server and Oracle, but lately have been favoring of more nimble relational databases such as Postgres at scale, and H2. For larger data sets, MongoDB, Redis, Casandra and Hadoop have all proved to be great noSQL solutions and great fun to build and deploy apps in modern cloud environments like Amazon AWS.</p>

<p>Over the course of my career, I have enjoyed working with talented engineering teams on a wide range of applications using different technologies. I have managed simple customer-facing applications and I have been fortunate to work with large teams on complex, high-budget, mission-critical code bases.</p>

<p>I focus on delivering quality products that are functional, reliable, intuitive and that meet specifications. I am thorough, methodical in my work. I document, test and check what I do and I communicate effectively. I am creative, very strong in analytical problem-solving and I’m always evaluating my performance. I like mentoring and learning from other people. I believe I can cook a decent curry from scratch and I can bake bread without looking at the recipe.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
I can be contacted through <a href=""https://mailhide.io/e/xK6Ya"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this reCAPTCHA</a> (requires JavaScript to be allowed from <em>google.com</em> and possibly other(s)). Make sure to make the subject <em>specific</em> (I said: <strong><em>specific</em></strong>. Repeat: <strong>specific</strong> subject required). I can not stress this enough - 90% of you can not compose a specific subject, but instead use some generic subject. <i><b>Use a specific subject, damn it!</b></i> You still don't get it. It can't be that difficult to provide a specific subject to an email instead of a generic one. For example, including meta content like ""quick question"" is unhelpful. Concentrate on the actual subject. Did I say 
<i>specific</i>? I think I did. Let me repeat it just in case: use a <i>specific</i> subject in your email (otherwise it will no be opened at all).

"254343","amn","","7262","","","<p>Bachelor's degree in computer science from University of Oslo.</p>
<p>A software developer by passion, hobby, and profession, ever since I learned MS-DOS on my dads IBM PC compatible computer in something like 1989. I eventually learnt C, C++ and Pascal with the help of Borland Turbo and DJGPP compilers, then enough x86 assembly to participate in &quot;the demoscene&quot; with some close friends.</p>
<p>I picked up HTML and JavaScript authoring around 1995 when I started surfing the Web on a dial-up modem.</p>
<p>As the Web was expanding and exploding at the turn of the millennium, I learned CSS 2.1 and was authoring HTML websites as profession, also learning HTTP much more thoroughly than before. Cold Fusion was a thing, I was using that to generate HTML and later XHTML pages. I also learnt XML, XSL and XPath, which were relatively unused then, for various purposes. The browser wars were raging which made developing standards compliant websites a nearly futile exercise. After a number of years full of developing Adobe Flash Player applications with ActionScript, I eventually switched to the HaXe language to make Flash Player applications up until Flash Player started its slow slip into obscurity where it seems to rest today.</p>
<p>These days I develop for the Web simply because I consider it an incredibly convenient platform as far as return of investment on deployment and publishing of information and software go; it doesn't hurt that the APIs cover so much ground one is able to write many more kinds of applications of the Web than ever before. I like working with SVG, too.</p>
<p>I do still occasionally dabble in writing Windows (and Linux) applications with both C, C++, and even Python, whenever I find good use for these technologies and platforms.</p>
<p>I also hold a keen interest in GUIs and UX design, programming language and parser theory and technology, software optimization techniques, operating system and OS kernel design, and 3-D computer graphics (in particular ray tracing).</p>
<p>By now you may be thinking that I am gaping far too wide here, but know that I do not consider myself &quot;spread too thin&quot; at all, in fact I find my broad range of interest within the realm of CS if not justified then at least invigorating and practical: all of the things I do, to me look like they're bringing me closer to some imagined software developer nirvana, or singularity -- knowing about very varying software development principles, approaches and quirks, teaches me to see the fundamental structures behind every kind of software architecture, common patterns emerge when you have developed enough products ranging from a command line utility to a network-distributed system.</p>
<p>My mathematics teacher used to say &quot;know little about everything, and everything about little&quot;. Can't say I know everything about some little thing, but knowing little about everything keeps me inspired. I want to be able to see both the forest <em>and</em> the trees.</p>

<p>I've worked for more than 16 years designing products for web ventures; from 3-person initiatives to large industry. Strong presentation and negotiation skills have been key to this work (in addition to the full monte; infrastructure, database architechture, core algorithms, scaling, backed and frontend frameworks, test-ability, compliance, and UI/UX + SEO). </p>

<p>I also design technology &amp; products by drawing from a history of fabrication, prototyping, sourcing, and scientific research (applied physics).  I am a practicing sculptor, and establish new product aesthetics via my own approach to engineering fluid-mechanical processes.  From this work in water, I have built a broad &amp; deep knowledge-base on the application of fluid phenomenon to industry needs.</p>

<p>I have lead successful small-capitalization stages, wrote grants &amp; engaged program officers, developed teams and timelines, tech culture and practices, design of experiments, measurement, and business development.</p>

<li>At the <strong>day job</strong>, I'm working with Spark, MapR (now HPE Ezmeral), and Hadoop in general.</li>
<li>Previously I was doing web dev with D3.js, C3.js, Node.js, Express.js, Python, Bottle.py, MySQL, Apache httpd. For many years prior to that I programmed almost exclusively in C++ (some C++11, some Boost) and Perl (I much prefer Python now).</li>
<li>I've <strong>dabbled with</strong> Go, R, Java, Google AppEngine, AWS, GraphViz, IBM Streams/SPL and BigInsights, Oracle OEP, DynamoDB.  I've read books about Google Compute Engine, Heroku, Neo4j, Redis, and MongoDB, and I've taken a few Udacity iOS courses (then I switched to Ionic), but I never got around to actually trying these out (bummer, eh?).</li>
<li>I created an online <strong><a href=""https://www.udemy.com/angular-2-concepts-code-and-collective-wisdom/?couponCode=stackoverflow2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Angular course</a></strong> at udemy.com, with an emphasis on Observables, Change Detection, Dependency Injection, Data Binding, and Inter-Component Communication and Data Flow.  Too bad the course is no longer up to date.</li>

<p>I am fascinated by computers, and have been since before I could read. My favorite programming languages are <a href=""http://haskell.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Haskell</a> and <a href=""http://python.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Python</a>, and I'm no stranger to C.</p>

<p>My childhood was spent on DOS and Windows 95. After learning to read, I managed to learn the basics of programming with the help of <a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/nh/secret/#guide"" rel=""nofollow"">The Secret Guide to Computers</a>, GWBASIC, <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/logo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">UCBLogo</a>, LADYBUG Logo, and some LOGO book(s) I can't recall the names of. I didn't much like GWBASIC, but at least it had a printed reference manual. I had also tried QBASIC, but had trouble with the online help, which I later decided was probably because all of the text was in the same font (making it hard to tell the verbatim code from the other notation).</p>

<p>[... Windows, VB, DJGPP, Cygwin, Mindstorms, POV-RAY ...]</p>

<p>Eventually I bought my own computer and installed a copy of Linux, and that's when I really began to learn how computer systems work: technical documentation for most things was available online, and if that wasn't enough to satisfy my curiosity I could look at the source code.</p>

<p>[... Python ... Haskell ...]</p>

I would be a writer. Then I got a job as a developer by a fluke and that was that. I still write a bit. If I'd ended up being a writer, I'd probably still hack a bit.</p>

<p>Indeed I still hack a bit, in that there's no better way to relax after a hard day's programming than to kick back and do a bit of programming. Right now my favourite off-the-clock project is contributing to <a href=""https://github.com/dotnet/corefx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CoreFX</a>. That would seem to be the main reason I was made a Microsoft MVP in 2016 and 2017, though I think that I've a few answers on SO helped a bit.</p>

"401179","Dan","","993","http://www.icednet.com","","<p>I used to do systems programming when the code was in Pascal and Assembly, on a Mac...  Anyone remember what Apple's Book 1 was?  Okay that dates me.  Oh yeah, learned that upstart language, C.
Nowadays, since &quot;programmer&quot; became &quot;Oh, you can make me a website, then?&quot;
I have taken on a few extra languages, Python (still my fav scripting lang), Perl, Java, Scala, and the obligatory JavaScript. Server-side JS (Node), Java, C#.
Serious side, I work in regularly in React, Vue, native Android, some native iOS, and all mobile frameworks.
I'm GCP and AWS friendly, tolerate Azure, am very experienced with Linux and too many flavors of Database (NoSQL, PostgreSQL, Mysql, and of course SQL, Redis) and, I'm a ML hobbyist.
Coding is fun, period.  When it pays the bills, it is a blast!  :)</p>

My grandfather was a Fortran programmer.</p>
<p>Sixteen years later, I was disappointed when my first PC came with no programming language, as that Internet thing looked fun. So I learnt JavaScript, and when the university refused to install Netscape LiveScript, I learnt Perl, which took me through my BA and MSc, and into freelance development until Node.JS fulfilled the Netscape dream.</p>

<p>Things that shouldn't exist today:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>CSS-preprocessors</strong> — just don't. Use css-variables, good naming
conventions and maybe a smidgeon of javascript in the client and
you're done.</li>
<li><strong>Styletron</strong> etc. — you've turned your CSS-management-nightmare into a
code-management-review-testing nightmare that makes debugging
impossible, and you still need to understand CSS to make it work but
now you won't learn it as you go along.</li>
<li><strong>CSS-as-javascript</strong> — See above. It's like Styletron except you've rolled your own and now no-one can understand what's going on.</li>

</a>
<p>Moderator  ♦  on <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com"">English Language and Usage</a> and Pro Tem ♦ on <a href=""http://portuguese.stackexchange.com"">Portuguese Language</a>.  I can most easily be reached in real time by pinging me in the <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/95/english-language-usage"">ELU chatroom</a>.</p>

<p>I’m Tom Christiansen, co-author of <em>Programming Perl</em> and <em>Perl Cookbook</em> from O’Reilly. I work for <a href=""http://www.grantstreet.com/careers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grant Street Group</a>, who are always looking to <strong>hire more Perl programmers</strong>. I can (sometimes) be reached via email at &lt;tchrist@perl.com&gt;, but that address is heavily spam-filtered so just because you sent me something doesn’t guarantee that I’ll’ve read it. I’ve lived in Colorado for the last quarter century, but have previously lived abroad in Spain and England. I try to spend as much time as I can in the Colorado mountains.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing Unix and C programming since the early 1980s. My programming interests include high-level languages, Unicode, regexes, and operating systems. My old <a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/407"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">O’Reilly bio</a> from ages ago mutters various ancient things about me, and some folks have gone and put up <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Christiansen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a silly Wikipedia page</a> about me, too. As a kid I lived down the street from <a href=""http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.10/cruise_pr.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gary Gygax</a> of Dungeons and Dragons fame, and worked for TSR throughout high school. I have ancient undergraduate degrees in Spanish and in Computer Science, plus a graduate degree in compsci focusing on operating systems design and in natural language processing. I’ve studied Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Latin, and German, along with a smattering of related languages thrown in.</p>

<p>The maxim that <em>“If you haven’t lost track of how many languages you’ve learned, you haven’t learned enough of them yet”</em> applies to both programming languages and natural languages alike.</p>

<p>My work manifested more and more towards backend development and architecture design of several systems and DevOps setups. I then started using Python and Bash scripting mostly for DevOps related functionalities at first.</p>

"543873","Michael","","8124","","North Carolina, USA","<p>Being an engineer with a vision is a curse.  You see the world as it should be, and you have just enough skill and ability to delude yourself into thinking you can fix things, make them better, and bring about a better order.  Problem is, nobody cares about doing things right.  You'll never have fast and reliable because people are cheap.  </p>

<p>As a result I waste my spare time wrestling with problems that should not be hard.  I spend an entire weekend trying to get code to work that's more important than anything I could ever achieve at my job during the week.  I'm not an engineer because I enjoy or even find fulfillment in solving problems.  I want to set things right, but my private struggle is that succeeding in solving a difficult problem is an embarrassment, a shame for all the time wasted fighting things not directly relevant to the task at hand. I'm an engineer because my mind commands me, drives me to fight against the subtle evil in the world, and I must either obey or give up my mind.  </p>

<p>What is subtle evil?  Things like the fact that one cannot simply develop once and have code that will run equally well on a desktop computer or a mobile platform.  That mobile platforms are second class citizens in the computing world when in fact they are just as Turing Complete.  Steve Jobs once said - to paraphrase - that it was more important to start with what makes life easier for the user and work backwards.  I disagree.  Start with what makes life easier for the developer by virtue of the fundamentals sitting right, and let everything flow from that.  You can't build a skyscraper starting with the penthouse.</p>

<br>
Btw, the glow of .NET is only observed in MonoDevelop, I dont kiss up to Microsoft in any way.</p>

<h2>Ideals</h2>

<p>I am pro-free software. I mean free as in freedom as well as price. I release major projects under the GNU GPL3, and smaller stuff I do is either LGPL or public domain. Usually things like CSS styles and gists, scripts, etc are very often public domain. In fact, if I do not display any license that means it is public domain by default for me, which is why I am writing this here (as proof of such). ALL of my ideals in life are to help obtain a freer world or whatever (care free ya know).</p>

<h2>LAME</h2>

<p>I do not boast and do this in my 'spare time' and alternatively work for some evil corporation and have another alter-ego. I agree that there are MAJOR busts to doing this -- I am poor as f*ck[1], but I am happy. If I (and I could do it, assure you) did make major $$$$, I would have to trade in my conscience and a good night sleep, every night, for the rest of my life. I could go into this in detail but you are not reading anyway.... No I am not a weird vegan hippy..  I just like having a good clean spirit, and isn't being happy what we all want, well I got that :)... my kids are ugly as sin compared to yours, my job sucks compared to yours, etc, etc.... its all good!</p>

<h2>HUH</h2>

<p>[1] Q: how do I have the stuff from the first paragraph?? Answer: I've picked most of it off the side of the road, seriously, I live in a state where people have to make a day to throw out their big screen televisions (flat panel) because they got a bigger one (and the parking lot pics would make you cry, it makes me cry every time i see what I dont have room to take home, going RIGHT into the dumpster!!! sad pathetic world...)</p>

I did lot's of consulting, porting of Windows apps to Mac, Mac infrastructure for ported applications, and low-level high performance coding (codecs, real-time effects, audio processors, even drivers).</p>

<p>I still think MacOS 7 was much more beautiful than MacOS X, but times have changed (sigh) and X has its benefits (Obj-C, Cocoa and the huge success of the platform, in that order).</p>

<p>Besides, I'm married (1 wife), have 2 kids, 3 Cats, 4 colored fish, and 5... something.</p>

<p>New to iPhone/iPad development, but I find myself at home, because Cocoa is my home.</p>

Since then I have experimented with numerous methods of development ranging from point-and-click type packages to C++. I soon realized that software development was what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>Having invested a lot of time into programming with various languages and technologies I now find it quite easy to pickup new ideas and methodologies. I relish learning new ideas and concepts.</p>

<p>Throughout my life I have dabbled in game and engine development. I was awarded a first for the degree ""BEng Games and Entertainment Systems Software Engineering"" at the University of Greenwich. It was good to finally experience video games from a more professional perspective.</p>

<p>Due to various family difficulties I was unable to immediately pursue any sort of software development career. This didn't stop me from dabbling though!</p>

<p>Since then I formed a company to focus upon client projects. Up until now the company has primarily dealt with website design and development. I have since decided that it would be fun to go back to my roots and develop games and tools that other developers can use for their games.</p>

<p>We have recently released our first game on iPhone/iPad called ""Munchy Bunny!"" (see: <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/munchy-bunny!/id516575993?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">View in app store</a>). We hope to expand the game and release to additional platforms.</p>

Initially did some system admin work in NT4, then went the direction of programming, working mostly in Access 97 (for frontend and backend) for about 2 years.

Picked up MySQL and Oracle. </p>

<p>In 2003, started full time development in VC++ with MFC. Started using subversion in combination with bugzilla for management of off-the-shelf kiosk application. In 2005, started dev in .Net 2.0 with C#. Actively develop company website transaction management in ASP.Net, with MSSQL 2005 backend.</p>

I love solving problems using out-of-the box thinking.

<hr>

<p>I'm curious and interested in all things science related. I've worked in plant genetics, molecular biology, and x-ray crystallography labs. I've also have been an active coder in various languages for about 15 years. I particularly enjoy machine learning, AI and various image processing techniques.</p>

<hr>

<p>I know a smattering of: </p>

<pre><code>python            bash (unfortunate, accidental guru)
javascript (ES6)  coffeescript (fun but useful?)
C#                java
Puppet            ansible (considered a language?)
</code></pre>

<p>I've been known to alter and compile a few <em>C</em> programs when necessary.
Learning:</p>

<pre><code>Ruby        Groovy

<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> Life; programming; SE: All invigorating!</p>

<h1>Why we're here</h1>

<p>The vision of Stack Exchange is important, and worth fighting for; our fight is not against each other, but against stagnation and fatigue. Do not become weary of doing well; and do not become content with your personal best!</p>

<p>If you're new, reach deep, learn (and then teach), and do more. If you're senior, train up others to complement or succeed you. Above all, let us celebrate our success! We're a community of competent, driven scholars: we have the best questions <em>and</em> the best answers!</p>

<h1>Why I'm here</h1>

<p>I like to think I am sharing in the experience of others here on Stack Exchange. I search for the perspective of others; and I take away value each time I visit; in turn, I hope to shape the experience of others in a positive way: by giving useful feedback, cajoling newcomers into constructive creators, and reminding senior members to continue giving the best of their experience&nbsp;&mdash; and the benefit of doubt.</p>

<h1>Who I am</h1>

<p>I recently discovered photography, and used a couple mirrors to take a selfie of taking a selfie. (Thus, my avatar.) As you can see, I'm always looking for a new creative outlet, and I enjoy puns entirely too much! My variety of hobbies (ranging from needlepoint to theatre) makes me relatable to a wide variety of persons: if I haven't tried it already, then I plan to at some point, and you're the perfect person to introduce me to it!</p>

"715292","Chad","","1501","","Springfield, IL, USA","<p>Once Upon a time a magical company called MagicDollars (for the sake of brevity for the rest of the answer we will refer to this company by its stock ticker M$)  and this company made the most widely used, operating system, internet browser, office productivity suite, and various other products. </p>

<p>M$ had this great idea to just integrate all of its software so that they would all work together seamlessly. This would be great for users of this software since this would make doing things like importing a webpage in a Ward processing (because in magicland we have wards instead of words) document, seemlessly and natively.</p>

<p>But this would evidently make the software too good. And we cant have people getting software that is too good. Because then if another company came along with their own version of good software people will be too dumb to install and use that if they have the already integrated versions that were included. So the Neanderthal Union decreed that M$ was using its magical abilities to make things too difficult for smaller developers to create super complex applications that they must give away for free. And said you will no longer make things work together seemlessly.</p>

<p>And instead of extending their middle wand to the NeU and saying fine we shall no longer make software that can be used in the NeU... M$ bowed before the luddites and said ok. So now you can not rename a file from inside of your office productivity suite in Magicland.</p>

<p>My ideal calling would be in a setting where cloud-native systems and infrastructure bridged the best of Agile, DevOps, SRE/CRE (and no! No waterfall/ITIL/ITSM craziness -- 15 years in and I'm not waiting on being sold) to build and operate meaningful technology platforms - IMO the continuing endeavour for the modern business, healthy employees, happy users and blue skies.</p>

<p>I'm still a learner and ever will be.</p>
<p>Mostly using Javascript, Node.js, jQuery, C#, .Net MVC.. but some times I also head for Die Hard VB when needed.
I have experience with IBM iSeries AS400 system and SQL, Mongo, SOAP, RabbitMQ.
I also have experience on Stocking and Certificate programs.
Usually working with WebServices and most of time spend on FrontEnd.
Really like debugging.. It helps me to understand others style/way of thinking.</p>
<p>Till now I've done all the projects only by my self but I really wanna get into team projects. Reason I've been alone so far is; I was the only guy that knew other programming languages/systems than the teams I worked with so that caused me to work in FullStack mode.</p>

<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
<p>I am Mansoor Khan, a full stack developer who loves the web. I'm passionate about semantic and standards based development. Efficient code, intuitive user experience, building responsive and interactive web pages has turned me into a thinking Frontend developer.</p>
<p>My knack of creating reusable, decoupled and non-redundant code has helped me become a better Backend developer. I strive to create backend solutions that conform to OOP/SOLID/DRY/KISS principles to make the web application more robust, extendable and secure.</p>
<p>In addition to my passion for the web, I also enjoy reading fiction, playing cricket/badminton and video games in whatever free time I get.</p>

"901641","ArtOfWarfare","","18303","http://marksfam.com","Haverhill, MA, United States","<p>Currently work as a Software Engineer at Ovitas in Burlington, MA. Previously worked as a Software Engineer at IBM in Littleton, MA, at Infino Systems in Cambridge, MA, and at Associated Environment Systems in Ayer, MA. Graduated from Northeastern University with a BS in Computer Engineering in April 2014.</p>

<p>Languages by approximate amount of time I've spent with each (last updated in March 2015):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Python / Boo</code>: 8 years (work and personal)

<ul>
<li>Don't tell the other languages, but this is definitely my favorite one so far. Everything is so compact and easy to read. Plus I love that 90% of tools you need are packaged in the standard library and that the next 9% are easy to install with <code>Pip</code>. Writing that last 1% is easy.</li>
<li><code>Boo</code> is Unity's variation on <code>Python</code>. It's compiled so includes more type safety than standard <code>Python</code>... it's compatible with Mono and .NET.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>JavaScript / JQuery / UnityScript</code>: 8 years (work and personal)

<ul>
<li>Unity will try telling you their language is <code>JavaScript</code>. It has enough changes that I generally refer to it as its own language, <code>UnityScript</code>. I've made some web games in it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Java / Groovy</code>: 7 years (work and personal)

<ul>
<li>I've made web apps, swing apps, and Android apps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Objective-C</code>: 7 years (work and personal)

<ul>
<li>Multiple apps on the iOS and Mac App stores.</li>
<li>I love that all arguments are named, but this language often ends up with unwieldy lines. I've yet to see any particularly good style conventions that are easy to read/write and compact for this language. <code>@property</code>, <code>@()</code>, <code>@[]</code>, and <code>@{}</code> were a nice start, but the language still has a long way to go before it even competes in the same readability league as <code>Python</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>PL/SQL</code>: 5 years (work)

<ul>
<li>I've found that I have a knack for optimizing SQL scripts to run far quicker... in my experience, scripts tend to run slowly because people use <code>join</code> much more often than they should.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>C/C++/C#</code>: 3 years (work, school and personal)

<ul>
<li>I switched entirely to using <code>C#</code> in Unity after support for <code>Boo</code> was dropped a few years ago. The language has really grown on me - Microsoft clearly started with <code>Java</code>, stripped out a lot of legacy junk, and added in a lot of nicer new features. I'd love a job where I get to use it.</li>
<li>Played around with OGRE 3D (Object Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) before settling on <code>Unity</code>, instead. Also, most class programming assignments called for <code>C++</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Racket / Scheme / LISP</code>: 1 year (school and personal)

<ul>
<li>I really like how consistent the syntax is. If anyone ever says they don't like these languages, they've either not tried it or they don't understand functional programming.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Making things better is the reason for my existence.</p>

<p>If something is out of place, I move it. If something is broken, I fix it. Need a massage, a cup of tea, or someone to talk to? I'm your man. I am deeply grateful to be alive and blessed to have the opportunity to make the universe a happier and more beautiful place for all of us.</p>

<p>I did construction and worked as a baker before getting my start in computers and programming 20 years ago. So I know a bit about hard (hot, cold, wet, and dirty) work, pre-dawn coffee, and pulling all-nighters (do they count as all-nighters when you're working the graveyard shift?). I'm also the father of four incredible children; three daughters and a son; every one a spark of the divine.</p>

<p>I've been doing web development 17 years and change, and have run my own business for more than a decade. This has given me a breadth of experience not every web developer can claim.</p>

<p>It is my aim to bring my diverse and formidable talents to bear on projects that matter as part of a team that shares a strong desire to co-create a brighter future for the generations to come.</p>

<p>I find myself to be an adherent believer of the proverb “Never Give Up”. I understand that the world of software engineering is rapidly evolving and is highly competitive. A software engineer needs to be always on his toes to keep up with the emerging trends, styles and technologies of the software industry.

"988445","Jerry Dodge","","25978","http://www.jerrydodge.com","Louisville, KY","<p>I'm a Delphi developer. I work for a software company which does solutions for retail management, including inventory, POS, reporting, BI, Tags, and more. It's been in Delphi since Delphi's been around.</p>

<p>I am actively in Stack Overflow monitoring the <code>Delphi</code> tag, and looking for those questions I can answer and also contributing my time to keep Stack Overflow in order. I'm not an expert in anything, a jack of all trades rather. But I love to help people when I'm able to.</p>

<p>I've known Delphi since about 2007 now, and before that, I had learned VB6. I havn't gone back to VB since I learned Delphi. I also taught myself QBasic and HTML as a kid. It hasn't been until the past 5 years that I've been diving into programming.</p>

<p>Since then I've also become vaguely familiar with ASP.NET with C#, as well as some C# windows apps. But I'm not too fond of the whole .NET idea. .NET is good for web platforms and such, but not for win apps.</p>

<p>My latest work has been with Delphi 10 Seattle mobile development. I'm still very raw on the subject, but see a huge potential behind it.</p>

<p>My strengths:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understanding the bigger picture of projects</li>
<li>Writing Custom Classes, Components, and Controls</li>
<li>Code organization (within unit or namespace)</li>
<li>Writing purely independent classes (as opposed to cross-referencing units or namespaces)</li>
<li>User Friendly UI's</li>
<li>Developer Friendly Classes</li>
<li>Encapsulating layers of business logic</li>
</ul>

<p>My weaknesses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lower-level coding (such as Assembly)</li>
<li>Platform-specific design (using Firemonkey)</li>
<li>Web Design</li>
</ul>

<p><em>It's always nice to know you're able to do something, even if you never use it.</em></p>

<p>Avid reader and insatiable learner, I started rearranging bits and bytes to make the computer behave the way I wanted, and help others understand the nonsense technology can be sometimes. Despite this love-hate relationship I've had with computers and the web, it is the thing I am most interested in and passionate about.</p>

<p>I've been developing for the web professionally for 14+ years, and have picked up a smattering of languages, technologies, frameworks and tricks that I use daily to make the best web experiences possible for users.</p>

<p>I am currently a front end programmer and software engineer, specializing in user experiences in Angular, Rails, Javascript, jQuery, CSS, Sass, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, WordPress, and various social APIs, responsive UI, IE8 issues, and a few others. I also have experience in ASP.NET C#, PHP, MySQL, MS SQL, Visual Basic, XML, CakePHP, ColdFusion, Prototype, a little iOS, and a dialect of ZPL (label printer code).</p>

In early 90s I worked a few years as a software engineer, then lectured informatics. After, I switched to hardware and was busy as network engineer. Back then I began publishing in national newspapers and magazines. In late 90s I started as web-developer. Since that I worked as lead web-developer for stc. Atlas, then for Red Graphic Systems. Currently I am a senior web-developer at Crytek GmbH.</p>

<p>My very first Open Source contribution was BCWB – an XSLT-based CMS in 2004. Since that time I have been contributing quite a lot. You can find my latest works at <a href=""https://github.com/dsheiko"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/dsheiko</a> </p>

<p>Over the last few years I’ve been creating Node.js desktop applications with NW.js / Electron. My first projects were made with JavaScript/Backbone, but the latest with TypeScript/React/Redux.</p>

<p>Some <strong>hints and tips</strong> around SO: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search"">https://stackoverflow.com/search</a>, click on &quot;Advanced...&quot; to show options</li>
<li>Search within your favorites: Enter <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3683/search-in-favorited-questions/161053#161053""><code>infavorites:mine search_expr</code></a></li>
<li>Search within your posts related to a tag. For example: <code>user:mine [C#]</code> finds all you have posted that is related to C#.</li>
<li>Run SQL queries against stack overflow posts: check <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/01/stack-exchange-cc-data-now-hosted-by-the-internet-archive/"">this</a> out to download an archive and <a href=""http://data.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SQL for SO</a> to run SQL queries against current stack exchange sites</li>
<li>Use keyboard tags, e.g. <code>&lt;kbd&gt;Alt&lt;/kbd&gt;</code> appears as <kbd>Alt</kbd></li>
<li>If necessary, add line breaks with <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> <sup>*)</sup></li>
<li>Syntax highlighting in your posts - Use a tag like: <br/><code>&lt;!-- language-all: lang-cs --&gt;</code><br/>For all tags, see: <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/72082/changes-to-syntax-highlighting"">this link</a> (meta)</li>
<li>Version tags: Use them to mark pre-C#6: <code>&lt;!-- if version [lt 6.0] --&gt;</code></li>
<li>To add runnable CSS/HTML/JavaScript code, use the code sample icon <code>{}</code> when editing your question rather than providing a <a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JsFiddle</a> link (but JsFiddle is good for testing). <br/>If you want to add runnable .NET code (C#, F# or VB.NET), you can create it in <a href=""https://dotnetfiddle.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DotNetFiddle</a> and add a link. For screenshots use the free tool <a href=""http://www.screentogif.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.screentogif.com/</a><br/></li>
<li><strong>Hide answers:</strong> use <code>&gt;! </code>, like so (point with the mouse):
<br/> <em>What is the answer to the <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ultimate question</a>?</strong></em> &lt;/br/&gt;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
<p> The answer is <strong>42</strong>.</p>

<p><sup>*) use <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> for superscript/subscript</sup></p>

<p>Summer 2020:</p>

<p>I'm reactivating my Stack Overflow account.  I'm hoping that I've learned to think about Stack Overflow more responsibly and to contribute meaningfully while avoiding non-meaningful contributions.</p>

<hr>

<p>Fall 2019:</p>

<p>I'm deactivating my main Stack Overflow account.  I'm sorry I can't respond to your edit suggestions and comments on my previous questions.</p>

<p>This isn't primarily about the huge mess on Stack Overflow right now.  It's about me being too caught up in getting another upvote and forgetting about the important things in life.</p>

<p>I'm still actively promoting Stack Overflow Teams in my classroom for the duration of the Winter 2019-2020 Quarter.  We'll see what happens as time goes by.</p>

**Short Bio:** Throughout over 9 years of experience on mobile software development, I have acquired a deep understanding on how to overcome the real hurdles of developing performant, robust, testable and maintainable applications from the requirement analysis to the architecture, design, development, continuous integration and continuous deployment. I have a strong fascination for CLEAN coding and SOLID principles. Problem solving is my passion regardless if its design related or architectural and I value the passion for problem solving minds. Usability, especially user intuitive and interactive UX for front ends and fault tolerance for backends are my prime concerns on developing any product. More importantly I enjoy Software Engineering and solely believe that this profession suits best for me.

To pretend to know when you do not know is a disease</p>

<p>The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy</p>

<p>The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool</p>

<p>He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to 
be captured by them</p>

<p>In dispelling ignorance, it is not favorable to act as an enemy</p>

<p>To bear with fools in kindliness brings good fortune</p>

<p>In punishing folly
It does not further one
To commit transgressions
The only thing that furthers
Is to prevent transgressions</p>

<p>All day long the superior man is creatively active
At nightfall his mind is still beset with cares</p>

<p>If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead, he goes astray;
But if he follows, he finds guidance.</p>

<p>The superior man understands the signs of the time and prefers to desist</p>

<p>The wisdom of a learned man cometh by opportunity of leisure; and he that hath little business shall become wise</p>

<p>You are equal to others, but you are not better</p>

<p>Quiet perseverance brings good fortune</p>

<p>Look to your conduct and weigh the favorable signs
When everything is fulfilled, supreme good fortune comes</p>

<p>Know what is in front of your face, and what is hidden from you will be disclosed to you.</p>

<p>Don't let your heart get big because of your knowledge. Take counsel with the ignorant as well as with the scholar</p>

<p>The greatest epiphany can be lost to the simplest distraction</p>

<p>The surest way to remember something is to give it rhythm</p>

<p>Earnestness is the path of immortality, thoughtlessness the path of death</p>

<p>Physical objects are not in space, but these objects are spatially extended</p>

<p>And that you remit the debt as alms. That would be better for you if you understand</p>

<p>The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay</p>

<p>It's a curious thing about our industry: not only do we not learn from our mistakes, we also don't learn from our successes</p>

<p>The tools we use have a profound influence on our thinking habits, and therefore, on our thinking abilities</p>

<p>There will never be a universal programming language since no one language is best for all problems</p>

<p>Now I realize that I am the power that commands the feeling of my mind and from which circumstances grow</p>

<p>Remember that man created method, and method did not create man, and do not strain yourself in twisting into someone’s preconceived pattern, which unquestionably would be appropriate for him, but not necessarily for you</p>

<p>What is not subject to choice is fact</p>

<p>It's not that the malicious code <code>understands</code>, they just need to match a pattern</p>

<p>1 &#215; 0; he who falls on this stone will be broken</p>

"1377895","Roman Vottner","","10484","","Vienna, Austria","<p>I'm mainly a self-taught Java developer with a bachelor degree from the university of Vienna in Business Informatics, with some knowledge in C/C++, Python and some other programming languages.</p>

<p>I have more than 6 years of professional experience in software engineering, mainly at ecosio.com, where I was responsible for the design and development of an HTTP based API, a SFTP Server implementation based on a custom Java file system that mimics a MySQL backed table as virtual files and directories, and most recently the integration of an AS2/AS4 related Peppol client and server solution. Besides that I regularly was responsible for profiling our applications to increase their performance, make suggestion on how to reduce database calls and the like as well as implement various client-specific applications, mostly written in Java.</p>

<p>Technologies I had to work with included frameworks like</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon AWS (S3, SQS, SNS, XRay and a bit of API Gateway)</li>
<li>Spring 4/5</li>
<li>Spring Boot 1.5/2</li>
<li>Apache Camel (from 2.4 on till 2.25.1)</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Redis</li>
<li>ElasticSearch (and a bit of Kibana)</li>
<li>JUnit 4, Mockito, Hamcrest</li>
<li>Docker and Docker-Compose</li>
<li>and some others</li>
</ul>

<p>I value design patterns and code clarity and am constantly trying to refactor code to improve overall code quality, readability as well as testability. The REST architecture concept is more than just a simple JSON based HTTP invocation to me and as such I do believe that I can help others in achieving a grade of decoupling where changes on the server side need not automatically lead to a break of clients. I am well aware though that this often is not easily achievable, nevertheless I am strongly driven to promote the actual idea of the REST architecture here at StackOverflow.</p>

<p>My current interests involve</p>

<ul>
<li>Distributed Computing</li>
<li>REST architecture</li>
<li>Java modules</li>
<li>Java concurrency</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p><em>Remembering that I'll be dead soon, is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in Life.
Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure, these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
Remembering that you are going to die, is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
You are already naked, there is no reason not to follow your heart.</em></p>

I focus on the open source tools for my development.  Mainly, I use PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and jQuery.  I believe in coding to standards, and using HTML5, CSS3 wherever possible.</p>

<p>I am always looking for mentors, as I have been 100% self-taught on the above disciplines.  My strongest point as a application developer is that I have major sales experience and business acumen.</p>

<p>My philosophy in building applications is simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build something useful</li>
<li>Listen to the user; the user is always right or they won't use the app</li>
<li>Build the app deliberately and quickly, test and correct for major bugs and release</li>
</ul>

<p>I am a lone developer in my applications, and have never had the pleasure of working on a software development team.  I guess this makes me a full-stack developer.  I think this is both an advantage and disadvantage; I miss the chance for learning new techniques and standards (but StackOverflow helps a lot with this), but I also can plan both the front and back ends of applications without consulting others.</p>

"1410669","UpAndAdam","","4201","","Chicago, IL","<p>I enjoy integrating systems to solve problems efficiently, making systems/solutions/processes faster, accomplishing things efficiently and fighting fires / aka solving problems. When not coding/developing/designing I can be found cycling, playing guitar or lacrosse, or training to do one of the three... unless I got lazy and am just relaxing on the couch playing a video game.</p>

<p>I've been developing professionally since I was in high school, including 3 years at IBM in Austin working on WMQ:LLM and a patent in managing a virtual machine. For the 10 years I worked at a top Proprietary Trading Firm in Chicago developing, supporting and extending our in-house trading platform.</p>

<p>I left to take a lower stress role with more latitude.</p>

<p>Day to day I main use: C/C++, Python, Bash/Fish, gnuMake, GIT and emacs, Docker on Linux and OSX.</p>

<p>I'm an emacs guy and I don't use vi/m, but I'm planning on finally learning it oddly enough. I can be the computer science equivalent of my father, a New Yorker from Brooklyn who after living 30+ years in Boston now roots for both the Yankees and Red Sox.</p>

<p>Older projects were implemented in <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> with <strong>jQuery</strong> and developed in <strong>Vagrant</strong>.

<li><strong>Self-development,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team collaboration,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Frequent and small deployments,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Simple and intuitive design,</strong> and</li>

<p>I am mainly a contributor to <strong>stackoverflow.com</strong>. Beyond that, I participate on MSO, MSE, and various other SE communities, mostly around software/IT topics.</p>

<p>My primary goal on stackoverflow.com is to <em>help</em> other folks solving their problems. Sometimes I am very direct; so please understand that I am not rude on intention - just honest. </p>

<p>If you disagree with something I say: simply speak up; I appreciate any (constructive) feedback!</p>

<p>On stackoverflow.com, I proudly hold a few gold badges, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>java tag: Awarded Sep 23 '16</li>
<li>Illuminator: Awarded Jul 8 '17</li>
<li>Legendary: Award Sept 7 '17</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Personal background</strong></p>

<p>I studied computer science in the late 90ies at the ""Universität of Karlsruhe""; nowadays known as <a href=""http://www.kit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KIT</a>.</p>

<p>After some years with smaller companies, I am working as software engineer at a global IT player for more than 15 years by now. </p>

<p>I started programming in Java more or less shortly after Java 1.02 became available. Java is still my main love, but there were hot affairs with C, C++, perl, python, and other, less known languages.</p>

<p>I am very much convinced that the only reasonable way to do ""enterprise java"" programming is to focus on ""clean code"" and ""tdd/unit testing"".</p>

<p>I like to answer questions on Spark, Hadoop, Big Data and Scala.  I'm pretty good at Bash, git and Linux, so I can sometimes answer these questions too.</p>

<p>I've stopped checking my filters for new questions these days, so I'm probably not answering questions which I probably could.  Therefore if you think I can help, especially with Spark and Scala, then rather than me give me email out, please comment on a similar question/answer of mine with a link.</p>

<p>Furthermore cross-linking similar questions can be nice for general SO browsing and good for SEO.</p>

"1603791","Stuporman","","759","","Belleair, FL","<p>I was introduced to development in middle school when a friend of mine got me into HTML. I took some programming courses in college, but wasn't satisfied with how slow and repetitive the curricula were, so I bought some advanced programming books and taught myself. I've been working in IT for my father for the last 6 years or so, and have done development in VB.NET, C#.NET, Silverlight, Java, PL/SQL, Android, and most recently Groovy and Grails.</p>

<p>I also have experience managing Windows Server and its core built-in features including Active Directory and Group Policy, Remote Desktop Services, and Hyper-V. I also manage an Oracle Linux 6 server and run Arch Linux as my primary desktop at work. I prefer KDE to GNOME, and I can't wait until they're done porting everything to the Wayland architecture because X.org really, really sucks especially compared to its Windows and Mac OS counterparts.</p>

<p>I'm not a Windows 8 hater, but I'm still puzzled by the decision to completely remove the start menu, especially on Windows Server. The start screen is fine, especially since 8.1, and the myriad utilities that cropped up to bring it back render the decision mostly moot now, but it is a good rule of thumb to deprecate a feature before completely removing it to ease the transition for users. I guess this isn't the first time, and probably won't be the last, that Microsoft accidentally alienated most of its install base.</p>

<p>I love science and science fiction. I've been around long enough to see some of the visions of science fiction authors come to pass. Remember the old ""Danny Dunn"" books? In one of them, Danny created a mosquito-sized drone that could fly around and invade all kinds of privacy. This was back in the 1970s!</p>

<p>I'm a 100% supporter of Web Standards, semantic HTML, and progressive enhancements. To me pages are content. Content which may need to be used by search engines, databases, visually impaired users, sighted users, mobile users, RSS feeds, etc. Standards help ensure that the content will be flexible enough to reach everyone it can.</p>

<p>Web site architecture and design is the most important thing to me. Design is about problem solving to present data and content to users in a engaging and usable matter. When designing I like to break down a project from the ""big picture"" into goals, actions, paths, and lastly down to the little design details that make a site or page unique.

My preference is to work on projects that bring something new to the table, where possible. I'm not afraid of new technology or paradigms either - if someone can show me that the new way is better because of x,y,z then I'm happy to try it myself. Friends have commented on my ability to, after having been shown some new technology, not only run with it, but start doing complex things with it. I have a tendency to forward plan everything, to a certain extent; as such I like to highlight potential problems and attempt to solve them ahead of time.</p>

<p>Mostly worked with Java</p>

<p>My still biggest project is a 3D OpenGL Maze Game that was programmed in Delphi.
You can read more about it <a href=""http://www.delphipraxis.net/168919-3d-labyrinth-spiel-opengl-9-klasse-informatik.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> (german)</p>

<p>I know I need to get my hands dirty with OpenGL again soon.</p>

<p>Currently I'm studying Computer Science at the University in Bonn. Here I like working low level with C and Go on network code. I also enjoy hardware design and math.</p>

<p><strong>MOST INTERESTING FACT ABOUT ME:</strong></p>

<p>I invented Google Plus. Well somehow. I was working on a social network similar to facebook with the difference that you have huge control about who can see what. 
You could put people in Groups (Circles) and specify what post or profile infomration you want to share with which group.
After I heard about Google Plus I stopped development.</p>

I stayed in programming until 1992 when I switched to system administration of a mixture of Unix and Unix-like systems.  Since then at home and at work I have continued my administration of Unix and Unix-like operating systems: SunOS/Solaris, Linux, HP/UX, MacOS.  However I have continued to use and enhance my programming skills and regularly use several computer languages (C, PHP, JavaScript, SQL, awk, sed, Bourne shell, Python) at home and at work.</p>

<h2>Hello World</h2>

<p>I've always loved interactive computer programs. I suppose that, for me, it started with the original Nintendo. </p>

<p>I still remember how awesome it was to search dungeons with Link, blast through hordes of aliens as Samus Aran, and save the world as the Black Night turned Paladin Cecil in Final Fantasy 2.</p>

<p>These days, I'm looking to join a group of other folks to work with who want to combine great UI/UX vision with uncompromising technical innovation to make awesome software together. </p>

<h2>More About Me</h2>

<p>Continuous Improvement Junkie
Highly Self-Motivated
Agile/XP Snob (I mean, promoter)
Python/Django Fanboy
Goofball (But Serious About Kick-Butt Software)
Designer of Relational Databases (In my sleep. BOOM!)</p>

<hr>

<h2>My Skills</h2>

<p>Interests/Experiences: Object-Oriented Design and Development, Agile, Continuous Innovation, Relational Databases (Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, etc), Python, Django, PL/SQL, and PHP.</p>

<h2>The ""should I answer this"" checklist:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Does this question adhere to the site rules?</li>
<li>Has no version of this question ever been asked before?</li>
<li>Does it seem plausible that others may have the same question in future?</li>
<li>Will (at least some of) those people be able to find this question?</li>
<li>Will I be able to answer in a way that helps those people?</li>
<li>Will my answer teach the asker something instead of just solving their immediate problem and leaving them unable to figure out how to solve the same issue the next time they get it?</li>
<li>Does the question seem well-intentioned?</li>
<li><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/7656"">How do I write a good answer to a question?</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Stack Overflow...</h2>

<h2>Asking tips:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Post a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve"">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a></li>
<li>Stick around for a while after asking a question to answer comments</li>
<li>Pop in every now and again to tend to responses at least until you have an accepted answer</li>
<li>Don't be a <a href=""http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">help vampire</a>. (My) summary:

<ul>
<li>Give enough details so the question is answerable</li>
<li>Don't ask for a program to be written for you</li>
<li>Aim to learn, don't just look for an answer</li>
<li>Look elsewhere for the answer before asking a question</li>
</ul></li>

<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/help/someone-answers"">What should I do when someone answers my question?</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Other tips:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Be kind</li>
<li>Format properly</li>
<li>Don't down-vote minor issues like minor syntax errors you can easily fix yourself. When downvoting answers, preferably comment and don't leave straight away: give some time for it to be fixed</li>
<li>Don't <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/155561"">robo-approve in review</a></li>

"1757805","Francis Cugler","","7470","","United States","<p>Self taught c++ programmer, main field of interest is 3D Game Engine Programming, DirectX or OpenGL both are good. I have learned the process from an empty visual c++ project. The video tutorials I have followed did not supply any source code, everything had to be manually typed and debugged. I have learned how to set up OpenGL and OpenAL for windows application. It took about 2 years and is a large scale project. We implemented 3 static libraries. A mathLib, objectLib and sceneLib on top of the main project. We had an ErrorHandler class, UserSettings class, a ColorOGL class and a GameOGL class, and a few classes for AudioObject within the main project. In the mathLib we had a couple of Vector classes, a Plane class, Integrator classes, Interpolate class and a GeneralMath class for most of the vector and physics calculations. The physics engine was small and basic with simple collision detection, simple AI, and animation. The objectLib contained a few derived Geometry classes, a class for our items and characters in the game, and a handfull of classes to import object or scene files from Caligari's trueSpace. It also contained all the objects for our custom GUIClasses, which includes button, radio, list, image and sliders. The sceneLib contained classes for player, camera, material, textures, textureTransforms, fonts, lights( point, spot, and directional) and node classes for our sceneGraph along with our Scene class which brought all of these elements together. We also wrote our own parser so that any of our objects textures materials, etc could be changed from a text file (*.lvl) and run the program without having to rebuild the app just to change a few parameters. To make the code writing process easier, we implemented three manager classes one for our Textures which also handles our founts, one to handle all of our GUI classes and one for our Sound. We also have a HUD and a Console implemented as well. We covered networking in a different series but it was not included or integrated into the overall gameEngine. With all of this we took the gameEngine refined it a little then built a playable 3D first person shooter game. The newest set of material that is being covered right now is doing a Series on Shaders using OpenGL.

<h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
<p>Over a decade of experience in a variety of stacks</p>
<hr />
<h3>Current focus (desired work):</h3>
<p>JavaScript|TypeScript + React Hooks + Ionic + Capacitor</p>
<p>Firebase | GCS Real-Time Databases + Cloud Functions</p>
<p>Go lang &amp; Python are my other love(s), but aren't getting much time these days</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>So many languages &amp; stacks over the years, I appreciate what I have learned, my desire for real-time data on a cross platform code base that is highly scalable (including authentication &amp; other cloud services) has overridden my desire to work in a more elegant language (for now).</p>
<hr />
<h3>Last year</h3>
<p>Rust, C, Go</p>
<h3>Outcome?</h3>
<p>I prefer Go to the other two, but find value in all of them</p>
<p>I will use each when appropriate &amp; still focus in JavaScript &amp; Cloud Services for now</p>
<p>Go is just an awesome language all together, Concurrency &amp; Threading in particular. Far more approachable than Rust &amp; C, while having a similar readability|maintainability of Python</p>
<p>Python has not been a focus this year, I do find it a highly readable
handy scripting lang &amp; love the data science aspects, most recently ML|AI. I see myself in the future perhaps serving models|apis for business needs. Previously I lead the ML|AI google coursework at my most recent employer to help others understand concepts &amp; syntax</p>
<hr />
<h3>Most recently paid for:</h3>
<p>JavaScript + ES6 + TypeScript + React/React Native</p>
<hr />
<h3>College</h3>
<p>Primarily studied (C++) &amp; built a strong computer science foundation</p>
<p>I also completed all coursework required to apply to medical school</p>
<p>Ultimately I decided I loved programming more</p>
<p><code>I &lt;3 c0d3 &amp; science</code></p>
<hr />
<h3>Code School</h3>
<p>Later I also was a top performer in code school (Python, Java)</p>
<hr />
<h3>Worked in:</h3>
<p>React Native, Express/Node</p>
<p>Rails/Related Architecture Rack Sinatra etc.</p>
<p>A bit of Django, but far more Flask</p>
<p>Various DB's
SQL:    PostGreSQL/Sqlite/MySQL
nonSQL: Firebase Firestore &amp; Real-Time/Redis/GraphQL/Hasura/Prisma/Mongo/etc...
cloud:  Firebase, GCS, AWS, Heroku, many more</p>
<p>Command Line Kung Fu (I'm good)</p>
<hr />
<h3>Data Science &amp; Neuroscience Researcher (Robotics, AI &amp; ML)</h3>
<p>Primarily Python (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy.stats, statsmodels, seaborn, etc)</p>
<p>&amp; JavaScript using D3</p>
<p>Controlled most powerful magnet on the planet for neural imaging</p>
<p>Analyzed spatial information for motion disorders</p>
<p>Completed premedical coursework; love computer science, research &amp; science</p>
<p>Arduino, Raspberry Pi &amp; IoT (as a researcher &amp; hobbyist)</p>
<hr />
<h2>Chrome Extensions</h2>
<p>JavaScript (YouTube SpeedSlider)</p>

<p>Started programming, when I was about 11 years old. I managed to base my career on my hobby and became a professional Java developer in 2007, (also a Certified Oracle Java Professional).</p>
<p>I mostly work for Belgian companies in food industry. I've worked on a couple of ambitious projects for Belgium's biggest telecom company, mostly to track their inventory. I've also helped out a dozen of companies writing java drivers for their industrial machines (in various exotic TCP protocols). Also a lot of experience in food industry.</p>
<p>In 2016 discovered Angular 2. Shortly after I started doing some React, Redux and Node.js and NestJS. These days I'm a freelance Node.js and Angular developer (at DeepZ), occasionally giving training as well. I mostly work in food industry these days.</p>
<p>When I am not programming, I used to play the Japanese/Korean/Chinese boardgame Go. I reached a 2 dan amateur level. And I played some international tournaments, such as the Korea Prime Minister Cup in 2014 and 2018 and The World Mind Sport Games. These days, I spend most of my free time on ZBaduk which is a cloud-computing company which I founded a couple of years ago. The company offers an online platform to use DCNN neural networks to calculate and predict winrates for boardgames.</p>

"1878788","bli","","6093","http://www.normalesup.org/~bli/useful.html","Paris, France","<p>I'm a bioinformatician with a background in evolutionary biology (mostly phylogeny).</p>

<p>I've always been interested in computers and programming. Here are some landmarks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In primary school, I enjoyed the (few) times where we got to learn some <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Logo</a> and draw things on the screen with the turtle.</p></li>
<li><p>As a teenager, I wrote my first program in Turbo Pascal in the mid 1990's (on a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Classic_II"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mac Classic II</a> on which I also played Shufflepuck, Sim Life and Civilization).</p></li>
<li><p>I later did a small simulation project (still in Turbo Pascal) as part of a biology subject in the year 2000. (My biology teacher was also into programming and encouraged me to do so, although it was usually expected to have a wet lab project rather than have it in-silico.)</p></li>
<li><p>I learned how to use e-mail and the internet in the UNIX computer rooms of my university in the early 2000's, where I learned a few basics in command-line, met hackers and got a first contact with a part of their culture, including reading the Usenet news and playing text-mode roguelike games (<a href=""https://crawl.develz.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</a> is a great game).</p></li>
<li><p>I installed my first GNU/Linux distribution in 2004: Debian on a iMac G3, lots of other UNIX distributions were soon tested on this machine, including Darwin, OpenBSD and Gentoo. The most tricky part in these adventures usually was getting the French Mac keyboard to be usable.</p></li>
<li><p>I learned the basics of Python during my PhD, to automate a method involving the comparison of phylogenetic trees.</p></li>
<li><p>I bought a Thinkpad T61 in 2008, which I still use as of 2018, and that runs under Funtoo Linux.</p></li>

<p>2 years in a technlogical startup, Passworks, working with mobile wallets.
1 year in Runtime Revolution, an in-house Rails consultancy shop: working in teams remotely to projects all over the world.</p>

<p>Looking for a Job in Berlin, Germany, relocating there in July 2018.</p>

<p>Took a full year backpacking in Asia once I quit my last job.</p>

<p>What I want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Small team.</li>
<li>Team-oriented colleagues, no one-man-genius gigs.</li>
<li>Having a say in how things are done and which direction the product takes.</li>
<li>Freedom to try new technologies, bonus if being incentivized towards doing it.</li>
<li>Startupish environment (the above).</li>
<li>Flexible hours, possibility of working remotely occasionally or full time.</li>
<li>Having a physical office in Berlin;</li>
</ul>

<p>What I am:</p>

<ul>
<li>Outside the box thinker.</li>
<li>Hard working, motivated.</li>
<li>A very quick learner: throw me whatever new technology you'd think is useful.</li>
<li>An eager learner: I want to know more, and better.</li>
<li>Very social, friendly person.</li>
<li>A good teacher, and a great listener.</li>
<li>Inquisitive: I won't take your word (whoever you are, a junior, senior, CTO or president) as fact just because of your standing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Email me on parreirat@gmail.com if you'd like to have a chat!
Got back to Portugal on 28th May and currently brushing back up on IT skills, have no Mac which I always developed on and as such I am getting accustomed to using Ubuntu.</p>

<p>See you soon. :)</p>

<p>Bonus: I think it's a far off shot but I love Game Development: have done quite a few little projects 4 years back and even participated solo in a Game Jam called Ludum Dare.
Have used several libraries: SDL, SFML, LibGDX, jMonkeyEngine, and a few small others, spread between C, C++, Java, Ruby, and Javascript. 
Would love an Entry level Game Developer position: do contact me!</p>

<h2>Personal Statement</h2>
<p>I envision innovative, impactful solutions to scientific and societal issues through the application of science and technology to the betterment of human health.</p>
<p>I accomplish this through</p>
<ol>
<li><p>the practical advancement of knowledge in functional genomics (the phenotypic and functional expression of the information contained within genomes), and</p>
</li>
<li><p>knowledge discovery, through natural language processing and machine learning approaches applied to the biomedical domain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These efforts build on my thorough grounding in biochemistry (B.Sc.), environmental health (M.Sc.), molecular genetics (Ph.D), and post-doctoral experience in informatics and knowledge discovery.</p>
<p>I am especially motivated by information retrieval/extraction, the construction of knowledge stores and graphical models, and the application of that knowledge to real-world problems including: molecular biology, cellular signalling, cancer genomics, and personalized medicine.</p>
<p>The union of my core domains (genomics; programming; natural language processing; machine learning; bioinformatics) enables a better understanding of implicit and explicit relationships and interactions, facilitating translational knowledge discovery.</p>

<p>I'm a self-taught programmer (dabbled a bit around 12, but didn't really get started until two years later) that just wants to get to know more about web development and computers in general.</p>

<p>Currently I'm proficient in the following languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>HTML/CSS</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>C/C++</li>

"2188862","Joseph Myers","","5926","http://josephmyers.com/","","<p>My PhD is in applied math, focused on real-world inverse problems posed via partial differential equations. I find it satisfying to implement ideas in mathematically-optimized computer code, whether for PDE numerical analysis, 24/7 scalable web server software, or HTML 5 apps. I truly enjoy programming in almost any computer language so long as both the language itself is efficient and the language also grants me the ability to be efficient by allowing me full control over enhancing the algorithms and operations involved. I passed the milestone of writing one million lines of code over 13 years ago and haven't been counting since then.</p>

<p>Coding can become tiresome on rare occasions when creativity is not invited to the task at hand. I therefore consider it a blessing that I can spend the rest of my time each day tutoring and lecturing at universities, because I never get tired of teaching and helping others.</p>

<p>As a side-job, I have tens of thousands of hours' experience in professional photography and writing.  My research interests are influenced by the imaging problems related to photography, in particular image recovery and more efficient ways of representing images in less space and with higher quality. I love a good algorithm, but more than all, I love Jesus, the Creator of all.</p>

"2225104","BitTickler","","8371","","Mannheim, Germany","<p>Started out as a C/C++ simpleton (around 1987).<br />
Leveled up to a C/C++ VB6 (later C#) simpleton (around 2001).<br />
C# LINQ came and people started talking functional gibberish - I got curious.<br />
Leveled up to C/C++ F#, Haskell, Erlang, Ocaml simpleton. Was around 2012.<br />
With C++11 and successors I needed to drop C++ because it became ridiculous. Considered to become a Rust simpleton. But after a while, I found myself thinking that Rust is in the uncanny valley of &quot;clerical systems programming languages with allusions of being a high level language&quot;.<br />
I ended my exploratory language voyage with Common Lisp and now I would call myself a C++/Common Lisp simpleton. As 2020 draws to a close, I just decided that Common Lisp will remain my main high level language for at least 2021. And possibly beyond that.</p>
<p>In 2021 I will also look into verilog/vhdl programming, given I am an electrical engineer and want to reconnect to my inner soldering iron ;)</p>

<h2>Well, hello there :)</h2>
<p>Just love reading questions here at StackOverflow.</p>
<p>As a software developer, I like writing tools and libraries to help me and my colleagues throughout the entire development process. I'm a fan of clean code and design patterns.</p>

<p><strong>2020 Question</strong>: How do you reverse a linked list?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: &quot;You can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Me 7 years ago</strong>: <em>writes GUI library in C++ and OpenGL as my first personal daunting project.</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: &quot;Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 7 years later.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Also me</strong>: But I like backend more <em>sobs and didn't answer</em></p>

<p>I am currently employed by <a href=""https://www.paciellogroup.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Paciello Group</a> (TPG), a <a href=""https://vispero.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vispero™</a> company. I have been with Vispero since it was a much smaller company called Henter-Joyce. Henter-Joyce became part of Freedom Scientific Inc. in 2000 and then became part of VFO in 2015. VFO changed its name to Vispero in 2018.</p>

<p>During my years working for Vispero, I have had the pleasure of working on products that truly make a difference in people's lives.</p>

<p>Vispero develops a number of assistive technology products for those who are blind, have low vision, or have learning disabilities. I have worked on several of the products developed by Vispero including <a href=""https://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/software/JAWS/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JAWS®</a>, <a href=""https://www.paciellogroup.com/products/jaws-inspect/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JAWS Inspect</a>, <a href=""https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/fusion/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fusion</a>, <a href=""https://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/software/MAGic/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MAGic®</a>, <a href=""https://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/software/OpenBook/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenBook®</a>, and the PAC Mate. Most recently I have worked on JAWS.</p>

<p>My primary programming language is C++ but I have done some programming in C#, Java, Python, and TCL. Most of the software I have worked on runs only under Microsoft Windows but I have done some programming for FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Solaris.</p>

<p>I have published several open source projects on my <a href=""https://svn.sullivanandkey.com/SnKOpen/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SnKOpen</a> SVN repository. One of these projects, the <a href=""https://svn.sullivanandkey.com/SnKOpen/cpp/yekneb/trunk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YekNeb C++ Code snippets library</a> compiles and runs under Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Solaris.</p>

thrive on learning new skills, experimenting with the latest technology and furthering my experience
through new and interesting projects.</p>

<p>My views on building solutions for business is that no common tool fits all solutions, each problem
needs to be analysed and its unique aspects considered, and the correct technology set applied to
the task at hand, meeting the client’s requirements not only in performance and technology sectors,
but also in cost of ownership and future enhancements.</p>

I also like Python very much, and have some experience. I had also a very brief period using Java, and a lot of small encounters with languages like Prolog, Fortran, and Lisp. Later I was working as a SCRUM master and then as an architect and supervisor of multiple SCRUM teams.

"2682142","lpapp","","47691","","Cambridge, United Kingdom","<p>If you appreciate the help I have provided on StackOverflow over the years and would like to offer a little symbolic present in return, I have one Blizzard game on my wishlist that you may know. It is the remastered version of the old game called StarCraft. I think it costs about the equivalence of €10-12. You might need to create a free Blizzard account for accessing this link, which is a shame on Blizzard, if you do not yet have one. The link will not let you gift this game to me if someone has already done so. So, there will be no waste created.</p>

"2891664","Radiodef","","35705","","Pennsylvania, USA","<p>I'm really a musician, I guess, but lately I've been thinking about pursuing programming as a career instead. I took a few programming classes in high school, but otherwise I've just studied it as a hobby off and on.</p>

<p>I know Java the best, but I also know some C++, JavaScript and Objective-C.</p>

<p>The most substantial program I've written is <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/Radiodef/epsilon/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Epsilon</a>, a text-based calculator, written in Java. <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/Radiodef/block-breaker"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Block Breaker</a> (a Breakout clone) is also cool.</p>

<hr>

<p>Along with computer programming, I've also studied math, philosophy, psychology and Japanese online (all to varying degrees), so I care a great deal about the quality of educational resources available on the internet.</p>

<hr>

<p>Below are some answers of mine which I'm particularly fond of, either because I think they're useful or just because they took a lot of work:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>I think all of my most upvoted answers are fine, but upvotes are really just an indication of the question's popularity, so they don't always correspond to what's the most interesting or challenging.</p>

<hr>

<p>If I've left a negative comment on your answer, please just address the issue and notify me when you're done. When I think issues that I've pointed out have been adequately addressed, I generally delete my comments so it looks like the conversation never took place.</p>

<p>I believe this is how most criticisms should happen on the site. Just fix the problem and move on.</p>

<p>A well-respected moderator of several StackExchange sites was removed for allegedly breaking the code of conduct. A StackExchange employee then made disparaging statements about the user to the media.

I have 24 years experience of working with markup, styling, scripting, data, vector graphics, animations and developing apps using client-side and server-side technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern Javascript / ES2015+ (Front-End Development)</li>

<li>a dash of jQuery</li>
</ul>
<p>In mid-2022, I'm now learning <code>Deno</code>, <code>TypeScript</code> and <code>Vue 3</code>.</p>
<hr />

<p>I also participate in different educational projects (different summer schools for 1-5th and 7-8th forms, teaching math, physics and electronics; science festivals, showing and discussing physical experiments; taught physics in secondary school for 1 year; tutored a student in math analysis for 1 year; lead some ""engineering"" projects in summer schools [actually those were mostly about creativity and making, not about real engineering]; some other activities). Have some experience in online education workflow as a teacher.</p>

<p>For now I'm not looking for a job, but I'm interested in networking with people who are interested in stuff below. Some fields of prime interest:</p>

<ul>
<li>systemization and representation of human-readable data (especially personal knowledge) and learning through hypertext; UX, front-end</li>
<li>digital workflow in news reading, data collecting, text composing (including scientific articles), human-human communication, collaboration tools</li>
<li>education projects: both online education (exploiting potentials of hypertext and multimedia, design-thinking) and offline (physics and robotics) education (and tools for it, like using hypertext for creating reusable knowledge base for teachers)</li>
</ul>

Instead of developing separate Android and iOS apps now, I just make one Flutter app and compile it down to native code for both platforms. For that reason, I'm not actively maintaining my old Android and iOS answers, so feel free to make updates to them yourself, even to the code (preferably testing that your changes work).

"3680301","Parthian Shot","","1288","","","<h2>What I'm not</h2>

<p>Unless I explicitly state otherwise below, you must assume I have no expertise / formal training in any topic. This includes, but is not limited to, assuming I have any <strong>legal, medical, or structural engineering, electrician, or plumber training whatsoever. I have no such training, nor do I hold any certificates or accolades in the aforementioned</strong>.</p>

<p>If you take my advice and it ends badly, you do so <strong>at your own risk</strong> and I can provide <strong>no warranty or guarantee</strong> as to my advice's efficacy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

<p>My advice is provided ""as is"". If you take my advice and it ends well, I am ""happy for you"", unless you are using the advice I have given to ""be a dick"", in which case I am at best ""ambivalent"". I do not understand why licenses feel the need to put ""as is"" in quotes, but I like punctuation (especially parentheticals and ellipses...), so I've decided to ""adopt"" that ""arbitrary style"" for the ""duration"" o""f"" ""this paragraph"".</p>

<h2>What I am</h2>

<p>I'm a computer engineer and computer scientist (with degrees 'n' everfin'). I wouldn't call myself an ""expert"" in any topic, but I like computers and am reasonably good at getting thinking machines to do what I want them to do. Currently working as an SRE at <code>$silicon_valley_company</code> writing Ansible and Salt deployments targeting cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>Personal opinion? After writing a <em>lot</em> of Ansible, I've reached the conclusion that no one should use Ansible. I've yet to come to a formal opinion about Salt.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>

<p>My favorite languages are bash, C, C++, Python, Verilog, Perl, and Haskell, but of those I'm only fluent in the first 6. I'm also fluent in Matlab (well... GNU Octave, really), Java and VHDL. And I like Scala better than vanilla Java- except when it comes to the collections framework- because mixins.</p>

<p>LaTeX is also fun, and I can use it wonderfully, but ``fluent'' implies I know a lot about the language constructs, which I don't, so I'm not.</p>

<h2>Platforms</h2>

<p>If it's an operating system whose name is a registered Bell of AT&amp;T trademark Corporation, or based on the aforementioned, I like it. Also like FreeBSD a lot (ran it on my main machine without a GUI for the duration of 2014). But I also quite like OSX. I know how to use Windows effectively, but that O/S is just too GUI-oriented to make me happy. And, no, Powershell doesn't solve the problem. If I wanted to write DCL, I'd be running VMS.</p>

<p>CentOS and Debian also float my dirigible quite nicely.</p>

It pains me to say that Stack Overflow's continued assault on the community has largely driven me away from contributing further. I never thought I'd say this about this place, but there you have it. </p>

<p>The community is what makes the network great and I'll probably continuing reading and commenting here and there as it's tough to go, and in the (increasingly shortened) times between between announcing the next terrible decision, I can still feel like it was what it used to be.

"3744479","Navid","","80","https://www.linkedin.com/in/navid-kalaei/","Shiraz, Iran","<p>""I'll find a way or make one!"", this is the all-time motto that kept me passionate to follow my curiosity about computers, become a Linux reviewer in my young ages, the student of all-time at bachelor's degree and win a direct entrance from one of the most competitive universities in the region for my master's in software engineering.</p>

<p>I gained all of that knowledge from academia just because of one mission: ""To help citizens and organizations reach their dreams."". I am proud that I could train more than a hundred students, facilitate sale procedures, and hunt the bugs that had potentials to crash a company!</p>

<p>But how could I benefit society more? I taught myself cutting-edge front-end technologies and mobile applications like React and React Native which there is a considerable demand for them beside concepts and frameworks of deep learning for prediction, computer vision, and natural language processing. However, I polished my skills with formal education by enrolling at Udacity after.</p>

<p>Now you can guess that I love bringing logical algorithms to challenging problems, demystifying client needs, and design engineered patterns regarding a trade-off between time and quality, and of course, implementing the projects.</p>

<p>Considering my personal life, I'm always passionate about exploring new experiences from learning a new language or skill to travel whenever I'm awarded the opportunity. This personality makes me able to gladly relocate around the globe.</p>

<p>I look forward to speaking with you to further discuss the business.
You can reach me out through 'navidkalaei' on Gmail, or let me know if a phone call or Skype interview is preferred.</p>

<p>Specialties:
◉ Languages: Python (5+ years of experience), JSX, ES6/Babel
◉ Front-End Development: React, Redux, React Router, Material UI
◉ Android and iOS Development: React Native, React Navigation, Expo, React Native Element
◉ Other: Linux, Git/GitHub, Scrum, OOP, Design Patterns, Database Design</p>

Before joining FB, I was the lead cryptographer at R3 and the Corda blockchain, one of the biggest fintech consortiums with the aim to bring smart contracts to the conservative banking world. My role required almost daily interaction with major financial institutes including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Barclays, ING, HSBC and technology firms like Intel, Accenture, Gemalto and Microsoft and I was mostly involved in secure protocol implementations, resulting in filing a number of patents in the cryptocurrency space. Prior to that, I was the CTO of two security and machine learning startups in which we created a platform for fair and secure national exams using time-lapse cryptography.</p>
<p>Before jumping to the industry, I had a short academic career in Greece and France participating in a number of EU research projects including Turbine, which was an effort to apply “touchless” biometric systems to airports. Finally, I’m mostly proud for my work in Timed-Release encryption, graphical passwords, key exchange attacks, verifiable random beacons and post-quantum signatures, having proposed some of fastest protocols in the field.</p>
<p>Interests
I'm passionate about state-of-the-art cryptography including Zero Knowledge Proofs, Secure Enclaves, Multi-party Computations and Post-Quantum Security. I also like implementing novel smart contracts, such as atomic swaps, decentralized lottery and auction systems and games on blockchain, like chess and card games. In my spare time, I'm working on a novel bio-tech architecture in which strong passwords are embedded in our bodies or triggered by brain signals to protect against shoulder surfing and password exposure attacks.</p>

<p>programming is supposed to be fun and it should be clear what the code does. That is my attitude to it.</p>

<p>Current Issue I think is important (or 'Bee in Bonnet'?) ;-/</p>

<p>On Answers: The following are my 'priorities'</p>

<ul>
<li>I try, really hard, to make it <em>correct</em> - but it <em>must</em> return the <em>correct</em> results according to my understanding of the problem.</li>
<li>I try hard to make it <em>good</em> as well.</li>
<li>It may be 'less than good' code
but it _must <em>return the correct results</em> that we all agree about.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
<li>i try and check the existing comments and answers to see if the answer i provide is 'different' and 'maybe useful'. Or just 'different'!   </li>
</ul>

<p>On 'comments':</p>

<ul>
<li>try to be 'useful' - i try. :-) </li>
</ul>

<p>On Iterating arrays:</p>

<ul>
<li>I really like PHP 'array's as each comes with an 'iterator' built in! See 'current',  'key', 'next' and 'reset'. I don't care what the 'indexes' are unless they are 'names'. I use 'current($array)' to get the first entry rather than 'array[0]' as the first index may not be zero. </li>

<p>Programming [Is that what I want as a career or is it a hobby];<br>
Writing poetry and short stories [some are not all that short]; 
Playing and making music and sometimes rap [stop wondering why I always have a headset]</p>

<h2>Greatest moments</h2>

<p>Wondering why this code doesn't work when suddenly you start laughing - how come you ever wrote that line.
Struggling with a piece of code and finding out the answer has been online the whole time.
Thinking that piece of code will cover 100 lines and finally doing it in 2 lines [has happened only one time].</p>

<p>I enjoy long code walks and eating spaghetti code over a candle-lit text editor.</p>
<p>Double Jumper, orange-mocha-frappucinno aficionado. Roughly in that order.</p>
<h2>Double Jump</h2>
<p>I enjoy the double jump. It's exactly like the triple-jump, but with one less.</p>
<h2>Checking the Documentation</h2>
<p>Another hobby I enjoy vis a vis Microsoft's .net technology is commenting on any errata I find - particularly with respect to punctuation. There, is nothing, more, annoying than a misplaced comma.</p>
<h2>WoW</h2>
<p>I also like playing WoW.</p>
<h2>Beauty Pageant Winner</h2>
<p>I've also won a beauty pageant. But unfortunately I had to forfeit it and go straight to jail without passing go. I still pocketed the $200 though. #BadBoyz4Evaz</p>

If you look closely you can see the noonday sun on Dec 21 at its highest point.  And of course that igloo can only exist about 7 months of the year.  Also if you look closely you will notice the dish is at an unnatural angle for the far north.  From there, the TV satellites are right down on the southern horizon.  And of course you have to wonder where the power is coming from to light the place and run the TV.  The only thing missing from this photo is my favorite thing of all:  The Northern Lights.  That is the one thing I miss most about Alaska.</p>

<p>the reason why I like these language: 
 these has light syntax.
 these are purpose-oriented.
 these are well designed.
 these are almost declarative.</p>

 how to manage CAD drawing data objects to design products efficiently.</p>

<p>With programming, I want to: master the management technique of information.</p>

Well design makes well management, well management reduces cost and saves time,
Reducing cost and saving time gives us liberty. Liberty is the only reason to work.</p>

<p>Not just that, some refer me as “Bug Doctor,” some as “solution scientist” and for some I am “code genie.” 
The attributes of such kind were conferred on me, because of my ability to turn software failures into up-and-running highly optimized applications, which eventually leads to exceptional ROI (Return On Investment).</p>

<p>My clients know me a person who can be trusted to fulfill the technical requirements that have been agreed upon.In Time. In Budget. In Style.</p>

<p>I live, breathe and sleep on web development. I believe good code doesn't happen by accident. It requires careful, deliberate and thoughtful analysis of situation at hand and then matching technologies to solve problem(s) faced.
Having perfected this craft, progressively for over 6 years now by working on various bleeding-edge technologies, I consider myself technically adept in the science of solution architecture and design.</p>

<p>In addition to strong technical understanding of ""how stuff works,"" I have good communication skills and client liaison ability as well.</p>

<p><strong>I thought I was pretty aware</strong> years ago... </p>

<p>You know - well educated, <em>big student</em> (of) science, metaphysics all my life, studied different religions and so forth.</p>

<p><strong>but I hit a brick wall</strong> eventually..., </p>

<p>in terms of what my intellect would do and I really <em>had no frame of reference</em>. </p>

<p><strong>but I was seeking</strong> ...</p>

<p>i was one of those people in life who <em>was always searching</em>. And the big surprise for me was <strong>the experience of awareness</strong> that really knows that there's a presence within you - that you can <em>rely on</em>, that you can <em>take solace in</em>, that you can <em>take comfort in</em>, that gives you a well spring of love, that lets you know that</p>

<p><strong>you don't have to seek for the things that we're taught to seek for outside of yourself</strong>. </p>

<p>As all the masters said, <strong>the kingdom really is within</strong>.</p>

Tenho experiência em front-end, back-end, Cloud, DevOps e um pouco de inteligência artificial 🤖 com o uso de redes neurais. No momento, tenho interesse em trabalhar com back-end (preferencialmente Java) e devops e/ou inteligência artificial. Meu maior desejo é poder aprender mais 📖, gastar minha energia em projetos ⚡ e compartilhar experiências 🌎!</p>
<p>Comecei a programar em C aos 12, desde então, apaixonei-me por essa atividade 💕 e experimentei outras linguagens como C++, C#, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Python, Go e outras. Já fui monitor de algoritmos, participo de maratonas de programação 💻 e também participei de um projeto internacional 🌍 de scripting/hacking para o jogo League of Legends (C#).</p>
<p>Atualmente estou estudando sobre Microsserviços, ElasticStack, Mensageria, Arquitetura de Software, DDD, Data Science e Redes Neurais (Deep Learning).</p>

<p>Flying robots. Driving robots. Lifting robots. Tall, short, fat, skinny, fast, lumbering robots. Robots are what I love and what I do…</p>
<p>I've been building robots for a while now; my interest extends back to childhood when I received my first remote-controlled vehicle. I would drive that thing for hours, almost hoping it would break so I could tear it apart and learn more about how it worked.</p>
<p>I went to <a href=""http://www.utoledo.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">college</a> to learn more about robots - getting a degree in Mechanical Engineering (with a healthy dose of Computer Science on the side) and becoming involved in as many robotics projects as I could. In my final year of college, I competed alongside a team of graduate students in a government-sponsored robotics competition. We created a pretty awesome flying robot that could map rooms and search for targets by itself. We won that competition!</p>
<p>These days, I create material handling robots that make possible the Internet storefront economy. All of the shoes, video games, books, and (let's face it) cat posters that we buy online are probably touched at some point by one of these robots.</p>
<p>Regardless of how you found me, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericschnipke"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">connect with me</a> if you love what you do! I want to surround myself with people who are excited for life and have found their own small way to change the world.</p>

<p>I am an organized, responsible and hardworking person and I am constantly learning new things and improving my skills to stay up to date with the latest trends and technology updates.</p>

<p>My previous work experience as an Angular Software Developer include collaboration with development team of 5 – 6 software developers, project manager and application tester. </p>

<p>My responsibilities were to develop user interfaces with the Angular 2+ framework, develop application features, write clean, tested and documented JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3 code, make sure that the development of the application meets the terms of specification and project documentation, access to external data sources and APIs in case if it is necessary to extract the data from any third-party services (SharePoint in our case), make design and technical decisions for Angular projects and bug fixing.</p>

<p>Our clients and business partners were large multinational companies like Sport Vision, Bosh, Daimler (Mercedes Benz), GazProm, Schneider Electric DMS and so on. </p>

<p>The projects I worked on were related to: the financial banking sector (functionality for adding/editing and displaying information about banks, loans, interests rates, reporting), then Daimler Employee Travel Planning application, Currency exchange services application for the Gazprom gas station, Internal portal for SportVision, Bosh production facility application for internal use and so on…</p>

<p>Also I want to emphasize that I have experience with Node.js, Express and MongoDB (NoSql), which I used to create application for hospital department (the application can be used for  storing patient informations, doctor reporting, medical history ... ).</p>

<p>I can quickly and efficiently join your team using code versioning and collaboration tools such as GitHub, SourceTree, BitBucket, Jira Atlassian, Redmine...</p>

<p>Over the period from January to  June 2010 I worked in Wunderman PXP as a Frontend developer and I help realize the technical aspects of web-based solutions for websites, online shops and mobile solutions.</p>

<p>I develop projects keeping the respective subject on mind and applying state-of-the-art standards, using tools and technologies like HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery. </p>

<p>As a Frontend Developer I convert PSD to HTML, develop an accessible, interactive and mobile first websites, writing semantic markup code which is well documented and easy to read, develop new user-facing features, SEO and assure that all code is validated before submitting to Backend Developer.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me, I will get in touch with you as soon as possible.</p>

My specialization in web development technology, allows me to quickly embrace innovative approaches and leading-edge technology solutions. I'm more into Cloud Computing and DevOps now. I love working with AWS and GCP services. I have the bare minimum knowledge in MS Azure and still learning!</p>
<p>After passing the 10+2 standard, I joined the Bachelor of Commerce course at Calcutta University. While pursuing the Bachelor of Commerce, I started studying different computer courses from the second year of the course as well. Then I pursued the Bachelor of Computer Application course from Indira Gandhi National Open University and graduated in 2005. I immediately started my career as a Junior Software Developer and got promoted to Senior Software Developer in two years. In the year 2009, I got the opportunity to pursue a master's degree as well. I completed the Master of Computer Application course from Sikkim Manipal University in 2011. I carried out my career as a Junior Software Developer, Senior Software Developer, Team Lead, Project Manager, and now I'm working as the Manager - Technology at CodeClouds, Wellington, NZ.</p>
<p>I use my technical knowledge, skill, expertise, and experience to analyze clients' requirements and understand their business philosophies. I try to deliver quality solutions and products on time with a high percentage of accuracy. I also prepare and manage project specifications, scope documentation, workflow, data diagram, and development documentation. I manage a team of around 90 highly talented members in a well-formed and structured way.</p>
<p>I love listening to music and watching action, adventure, thriller, horror movies, and Discovery, Animal Planet, and Nat Geo TV channels. Photography is also one of my hobbies, however, I'm an amateur! I like to read technical articles, journals, and documentaries about Indian Himalayas and wildlife. I'm passionate about adventure sports. I encourage people to love adventure sports.</p>
<p>I've traveled to many places and trekked in several parts of the Himalayas in India and Nepal. I'm a member of &quot;MTG - Miles To Go&quot; - a nature lover's association in Kolkata. I've done the Rock Climbing course from Parvat Abhiyatri Sangha affiliated with Anandabazar Patrika. I also participate in several community initiatives taken by an NGO.</p>

<p>I try <em>not</em> to answer a question if my answer will only be a duplicate of another, or there's a potentially good answer (in which case I would comment to suggest modification, or modify it myself).

<p>Some of the source code of the answers (typically ones with lists) is manually wrapped at the width of the editor, so that the source reads good when their font is monospaced, as I set in my browser. I believe that Markdown is designed to look good when read as plain text.</p>

I specialize in designing and developing successful .NET applications using C# and Web applications using technologies such as Angular, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC/Web API &amp; Azure Cloud.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, and in my own time I have been self-teaching myself .NET and C# skills in the area on ASP.NET MVC/Web API &amp; on the other hand Angular for the front-end technology and using the Azure cloud as a cloud platform. I have been blogging my progress and creating Open Source projects to flex my skills. I hope to start learning Xamarin stack and creating apps for the Android, IOS &amp; Windows using C# and XAML and hopefully to learn Go lang to work on system programming. I also use my own time to refine my skills and prepare for certification. For example, at the moment I'm preparing to take certification on Azure for developers.</p>
<p>Soft Skills:-
I’m a very able communicator, not just via the written word, but I would rather pick up the phone and chat with someone. I’m able to know my audience and understand if I can chat &quot;techie&quot; or not to try and get my point across. I’m confident in my abilities to work with our clients to successfully deliver.</p>
<p>I would say I’m approachable and well-liked by the people who know me, and people whom I work with. Also working within a Scrum environment, you need to be able to work closely as a team and form good relationships and self-organize on a daily basis.</p>

My intention is not only to provide a solution, but to provide a solution extensible enough to adapt to new upcoming situations as well as comprehensible enough to understand it on the first glance by the other team members. This will reduce the time spent on the code maintenance and improve the team velocity, improving systemically the team's efficiency in delivering new features.</p>

I have good experience of making android apps and publishing them on Play Store. I can also make web apps with angular and games with Unity. I also did an ethical hacking course from udemy. I also did a basic course of machine learning.</p>
<p>My story --
I just completed internship in a medical college (for MBBS degree). I chose biology in my 11th std. In my 2nd year of college, I realized that I chose a wrong career path. Programming is my passion but I chose biology because both my parents are doctors. In 2nd yr, I decided that I will not continue the medical field and will do programming.</p>
<p>I started doing online courses on coursera (on audit). By now, I have completed more than 25 courses on coursera (on audit) for topics including android app development, front-end and back-end web development, algorithms and data structures, game development with Unity, machine learning, neural networks with deep learning, ethical hacking.</p>

"9583480","s3c","","725","https://sws.si","Slovenska Bistrica, Slovenia","<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>I've been studying at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia from 2008 to 2012. After that and additional 6 years of doing manual labour (wood cutting and later roofing) I finally decided, to do what I loved since I found out about it - programming.</p>
<h1>2021 (June)</h1>
<p>PHP 8.x rocks! Still hadn't gotten around with Laravel much, because the company wasn't ready for the move to the framework, and I'm really short on time in my private life with my partner, family, chess, sudoku-variant puzzles and sports. Partially rewritten our backend for websites using a MVC structure. Started with more and more OOP this year.</p>
<p>I figured out GIT and made a GIT server with self-hosted GitLab for our company (basically forced everyone to start using it).</p>
<p>Figured out SASS and modularized our styling sources, for them to later be compiled into one bundle. Did pretty much the same thing for scripts using tsconfig.json, but still staying with ES6 vanilla JavaScript and not writing any TypeScript.</p>
<p>The most improvement made for our websites' discoverability was in the last two months when I dived deep into modern SEO rules (including multi-language). Creating my own Route class (imitating that of Laravel) helped with that a lot, along with dissecting all our spaghetti code into MVC. Using Lighthouse on <a href=""https://web.dev/measure/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">web.dev</a> I've upped our game for Performance/Accessibility/Best Practices/SEO from 20-70/40-50/50-70/40-60 to 80-95/100/100/100 every time. Feels like an achievement.</p>
<h1>2020 (July)</h1>
<p>SO. MUCH. TO. LEARN. I've been using ECMAScript6+ for the last half a year, and dropped jQuery completely. Also improving my understanding and usage of Three.js library. PHP-wise I'm adopting the latest versions (currently 7.4) and eagerly awaiting PHP 8.</p>
<p>Not the least mentioning-worth skill I'm improving on is Laravel (with no prior knowledge).</p>
<p>Oh, and I keep forgetting my projects in Xamarin.Forms (XAML, C#) - I make them work, but not really sure how. Oops.</p>
<h1>2019 (March)</h1>
<p>I've gathered loads of experiences in HTML, CSS, PHP and JS, but the more I know, the more I see how clueless I am. As I develop web applications I further develop myself and will continue to do so in the future.</p>
<h1>2018 (September)</h1>
<p>I was lucky enough for a company called 8000plus d.o.o. to hire me without any experiences or knowledge, just based on my personality and whom I presented myself as - an enthusiast who will programme with or without them.</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll remember to update this description every year.</p>

<p>Hello There.</p>
<p>I am a software developer with a great passion for solving problems utilizing Google products and Development tools.</p>
<p>Java is the first programming language I acquired. After learning the Java Spring Framework, I got the sweet taste of enterprise development. Implementation of the dependency injection and Inversion Of Control in Spring Boot Framework took me to the next level.</p>
<p>Personal specialities include quick learning, quick typing, quick-talking, quick forgiving.</p>
<p>Technical specialities include angular, the one who got me out of hell by its amazingly-awesomely-practically implemented dependency injection and Inversion of control like his big grandfather Java Spring Framework; angular material, just like a beautiful lady walking down a steep street trying to hold herself as straight as possible for the sake of retaining her gorgeousness; bootstrap, the cutest CSS framework I have feelings about; typescript, the most handsome and coolest guy in the club, he gets along with everything and everybody; JavaScript, exquisite subway sandwich nobody dares to betray; NestJS, to which I am kind of emotionally attached, also it is among the ones following the right path in the long-running marathon; NodeJS, home home, sweet home; Java &amp; Java Spring Framework, the best mentors I have ever had; Selenium, who is the guy just making fun of people and doing his job as extraordinary as simple as clear as spring water;</p>
<p>I believe we must be responsible for each other; responsive to each other; relate our problems; recover each other from any sorrow and difficult circumstances; refine our feelings to each other. After doing all, I believe we would be reborn and rediscover a better world right in front of us.</p>

"12786296","bombom","","91","","USA","<p>Currently, I am a self-taught Software Engineer. I am a student of AS in Computer Science. Still studying to build my skills and trying to become a problem solver in any case. This was likely the best advice I was given at the beginning of my learning journey. When I first started out, it was overwhelming. Did I want to do front-end, back-end, something in between? Which languages are best for which part of the stack? I spent a few weeks reading and doing tutorials in different languages to test the waters. I was wasting time and confusing myself. a self-taught software engineer, or at least didn’t major in CS as an undergrad. And he’s pretty clearly addled; on top of his “women are dumb and don’t like the computers” manifesto (I’m paraphrasing a bit), he wrote an insane tweet about the Ku Klux Klan being successful because they have really cool, Dungeons &amp; Dragons-like titles. If he can do it, so can you. Just don’t be like him.</p>
<p>Self-taught developers of course normally don’t start at Google. They learn the ropes elsewhere, then move (if they can and want to).</p>

"12074081","Juan Vieira","","108","","","<p>As a Team Leader: I take pride in collaborating with my team, leading by example, getting my hands dirty, and helping them reach their full potential
As a Full Stack Developer: My passion for coding and my thirst to learn and grow, make me enjoy every single step of the development cycle, from requirements, to design, implementation and delivery. They also make me all rounded, capable of working on any layer of the stack, and owning every line of code
As a Person: I commit to what I do, and I'm selective in what I do. If I believe in a product, mission, or idea, I'll give it my 100%. I want to make every day count, and grow towards a goal. My main goal now? Make a difference, leave the Planet a little bit better than how I found it, and help as many people as I can as a mentor or a teacher</p>
<p>I've been lucky enough to work with many programming languages and technologies. I would highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Front-end: React (NextJS [SSR, SSG, SPA, PWA]), Hooks, SASS, Styled Components, .NET</li>
<li>Native/Multiplatform: Flutter, PWA, React Native</li>
<li>API/Microservices: NodeJS (NestJS), Java Springboot, Golang (Rebel, Fiber), .NET</li>
<li>Integrations: MuleSoft, Apache Camel, Node-red</li>
<li>Cloud: AWS, GCP, Firebase, Supabase</li>
<li>DevOps: Jenkins, Puppet, Ansible, Docker, K8s</li>
<li>DB: MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, MongoDB, Aurora, Redshift</li>
<li>And played around with much more: GraphQL, Kotlin, Svelte, FaunaDB,...</li>
</ul>
<p>Green energies and environmental projects are some of my passions, therefore I'm always looking for collaborations and activities I can get involved in.
As I mentioned, I enjoy teaching and sharing programming. I've had the honor to be a programming teacher for teenagers and private students, a mentor in programming meetups and I'm planning to participate as a speaker soon.</p>

<p>Some thoughts (even if you're not using XHTML):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spell out attributes. <code>&lt;button disabled&gt;</code> becomes <code>&lt;button disabled=&quot;disabled&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Self close tags. <code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Use double quotes in HTML. Not <code>&lt;font face=Arial&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If I see your question with some downvotes, there's going to be an upvote if you tried hard. Just keep browsing your inbox!</p>

<p> There is no <strike>free lunch</strike> <strong>reputation for doing nothing.</strong><br />
 I want to leave no one at 1 reputation.<br />
 Note: I'm mostly on Stack Overflow.

 ----------

 1. Try hard. No one gets 1 -&gt; 101 reputation in a week.

 2. Posts are not upvoted if they aren't showing your hard work!

 3. Upvotes are just &quot;We think it is good, but we don't want to tell you who we are. Here. +10 for you.&quot;

 - &lt;-- For messy, uncategorized stuff. ● ● ● ● ●!!!

 - I help beginners format their questions.
