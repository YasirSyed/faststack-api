<p>C++ is a (mostly) <a href=""//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_typing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">statically-typed</a>, free-form, (usually) compiled, multi-paradigm, intermediate-level general-purpose programming language; not to be confused with <a href=""/tags/c/info"">C</a> or <a href=""/tags/c++-cli/info"">C++/CLI</a>. It was developed in the early 1980s by <a href=""//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bjarne Stroustrup</a>, initially as a set of extensions to the C programming language. Building on C, <a href=""//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C++</a> improved <a href=""//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">type-safety</a> and added support for automatic resource management, object-orientation, generic programming, and exception handling, among other features.</p>
<hr />
<h2>New to C++?</h2>
<p>Whether you are new to programming or coming to C++ from another programming language, it is highly recommended to have a good book from which to learn the language. We keep a detailed <a href=""/a/388282"">list of books</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking for good compilers, <a href=""//gcc.gnu.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GCC</a> is the most commonly used compiler on Linux and other Unix-like platforms; <a href=""//clang.llvm.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Clang</a> is the official compiler on Mac and FreeBSD; Microsoft <a href=""//www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Visual C++</a> is the most commonly used compiler on Windows. The <a href=""//software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/compilers/c-compilers.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IntelÂ® C++ Compiler</a> is also commonly used for its optimized numerical computations on Windows, Linux, and Mac.</p>
<p>Turbo-C++ 3.0 is from 1991, extremely outdated, and definitely not recommended. See the previous paragraph for free choices from this millennium.</p>
<p><a href=""//chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/10"">Join us in chat</a>, where we discuss C++, programming in general, and even other stuff when the sun goes down and boredom creeps in. Don't forget your sense of humor, but keep it civilized.</p>

<p><strong>When posting questions about C++ programming, please make sure to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Target system and compiler information. This includes the compiler name, version, and settings used to compile.</li>
<li>If your question is specific to one particular version of the the language, add  <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b98"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++98&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++98</a> <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b03"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++03&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++03</a> <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b11"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++11&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++11</a> <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b14"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++14&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++14</a> <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b17"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++17&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++17</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b20"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++20&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++20</a> or <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b23"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++23&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++23</a>. Questions about boost should add the tag <a href=""/questions/tagged/boost"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;boost&#39;"" rel=""tag"">boost</a>. Details about the different versions can be found further below in this wiki.</li>
<li>Unless the question explicitly mentions which version of the C++ standard is used, it is assumed that the current version is used. That is, whichever version of ISO 14882 that ISO currently lists as active. Please have this in mind when answering or commenting on questions tagged <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a>.</li>

<h3>Using <a href=""/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a> together</h3>
<p>C and C++ are two distinct and often incompatible languages. Avoid using both tags in the same question unless you have good reasons.</p>
<p><strong>A question should be tagged with <a href=""/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> only, if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It contains pure C, with no trace of C++, or questions with code that could be either language.</li>
<li>The code is compiled with a C compiler.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A question should be tagged with <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a> only, if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It contains code with <em>any</em> C++ features. Even though the code may be &quot;C style&quot;.</li>
<li>The code is compiled with a C++ compiler.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A question should be tagged with both <a href=""/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a> if it is about:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Specific differences between C and C++.</li>
<li>Compatibility or porting code between C and C++.</li>
<li>C++ code that uses C libraries (for example code using <code>extern &quot;C&quot;</code>).</li>

<h3>Editing and moderation guidelines for posts with both <a href=""/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a> tags:</h3>
<p>To edit/re-tag/moderate questions with both tags, it is recommended that you have full edit privileges and either a gold <a href=""/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> or a gold <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a> badge.</p>
<p>If you encounter a post with both tags, edit/re-tag it if needed according to the above rules. If you can tell the language by reading the posted code, simply edit tags accordingly. Avoid prompting the user &quot;is it C or C++?&quot; in comments unless the question is truly unclear.</p>
<p>One example of an unclear question is when the user explicitly claims that they are programming in C, but posts code or compiler messages for C++. If so, prompt for clarification and close-vote as unclear.</p>
<p>&quot;Either C or C++ is fine&quot; opinions from the OP is a strong indication of a poor or unclear question. Answers may be very different depending on language picked. Prompt for clarification, close as unclear/too broad until the OP has clarified this.</p>
<p>Be careful about re-tagging questions once there are answers posted, particularly if there are already both C and C++ answers posted. In such cases, the tags should be left alone, since changing them would make posted answers invalid.</p>
<p>Answers with C++ code to a C question that has never been tagged <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a>  should be deleted as off-topic. Please check the question edit history before flagging/deleting such answers, to verify that the question never had the C++ tag.</p>

<h3><a href=""/tags/c++98/info"">C++98</a></h3>
<p>In 1998, the C++ standards committee published the first international standard for <a href=""http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=25845"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C++ ISO/IEC 14882:1998</a>, which would be informally known as C++98.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a href=""/tags/c++03/info"">C++03</a></h3>
<p>In 2003, the C++ Committee responded to multiple problems that were reported with <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b98"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++98&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++98</a>, and revised it accordingly. The changed language was dubbed <strong>C++03</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a href=""/tags/c++11/info"">C++11</a></h3>
<p>The language standard remained pretty much the same for a long time, but in 2011 a new standard, C++11 (formerly known as C++0x) was published in <a href=""//www.iso.org/standard/50372.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISO/IEC 14882:2011</a>. Rather than in a &quot;big bang&quot; approach, it is being rolled out gradually as compilers are supporting the new language features. See <a href=""//www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bjarne Stroustrup's C++11 FAQ</a> to see what is new in the language, and check your own compiler's FAQ to see which of those features are currently supported:</p>

<h3><a href=""/tags/c++14/info"">C++14</a></h3>
<p>C++14 is a small extension to C++11. It was approved in August 2014 and released in December of the same year. Previously referred to as C++1y as the year of approval was uncertain. Many popular compilers already have some level of C++14 support.</p>

<h3><a href=""/tags/c++17/info"">C++17</a></h3>
<p>C++17 adds a few more major features (and several minor ones). It is usually referred to as C++1z or C++17, as technical work on the new standard was completed in March of 2017. The draft standard was approved (unanimously) by the <a href=""//isocpp.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISO</a> in September of 2017 and <a href=""//www.iso.org/standard/68564.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">officially published</a> in December 2017.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>A GNU/Linux-based system is a modular Unix-like operating system. It derives much of its basic design from principles established in Unix during the 1970s and 1980s. Such a system uses a monolithic kernel that handles process control, networking, and peripheral and file system access. Device drivers are either integrated directly with the kernel or added as modules loaded while the system is running.</p>
<p>Separate projects that interface with the kernel provide much of the system's higher-level functionality. The GNU user land is an important part of most GNU/Linux-based systems, providing the most common implementation of the C library, a popular shell, and many of the common Unix tools which carry out many basic operating system tasks. The graphical user interface (or GUI) used by most GNU/Linux systems is built on top of an implementation of the X Window System.</p>

<h2>Tag Usage</h2>
<p>The <a href=""/questions/tagged/linux"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;linux&#39;"" rel=""tag"">linux</a> tag on Stack Overflow is generally used for questions about:</p>
<ul>
<li>programming against the APIs supplied by the operating system</li>
<li>the implementation of the kernel</li>
<li>programming tools and techniques for use <em>on</em> a Linux-based system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notable questions that probably don't belong are:</p>
<ul>
<li>questions about using a desktop or laptop GNU/Linux system are better directed towards <a href=""https://superuser.com/"">Super User</a>, <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com"">Unix &amp; Linux</a>, <a href=""https://askubuntu.com"">Ask Ubuntu</a>, or <a href=""https://elementaryos.stackexchange.com/"">ElementaryÂ OS</a> if they're specifically about those distributions.</li>
<li>questions about administering GNU/Linux systems for other users and networking GNU/Linux systems in a context more complicated than a minimal home network are better directed towards <a href=""https://serverfault.com/"">Server Fault</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many questions about GNU/Linux can <em>also</em> be properly tagged as <a href=""/questions/tagged/unix"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;unix&#39;"" rel=""tag"">unix</a>, but some features are specific to GNU/Linux and are not found on other Unixâ¢ and Unix-like operating systems. If you have questions about a specific distribution and version (e.g., <a href=""/questions/tagged/ubuntu-14.04"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ubuntu-14.04&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ubuntu-14.04</a>, it may not be necessary to use this tag for that question.</p>
<p>A fair number of <a href=""/questions/tagged/linux"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;linux&#39;"" rel=""tag"">linux</a> questions are questions about the command shell (<code>bash</code> by default on many systems), and are probably better tagged with <a href=""/questions/tagged/shell"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;shell&#39;"" rel=""tag"">shell</a> and/or the particular shell you are interested in (<a href=""/questions/tagged/bash"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;bash&#39;"" rel=""tag"">bash</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/zsh"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;zsh&#39;"" rel=""tag"">zsh</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/tcsh"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;tcsh&#39;"" rel=""tag"">tcsh</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>Questions about the internals of the Linux kernel or regarding writing Linux kernel modules should be tagged <a href=""/questions/tagged/linux-kernel"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;linux-kernel&#39;"" rel=""tag"">linux-kernel</a>.</p>

"5","3607013","","","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C (pronounced <em>&quot;See&quot;</em>, like the letter C)</a> is a general-purpose computer programming language developed between 1969 and 1973 by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dennis Ritchie</a> at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bell Telephone Laboratories</a> for use with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UNIX operating system</a>. Its design provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language. It is a highly efficient procedural programming language and has an emphasis on functions whereas modern object-oriented programming languages tend to emphasize data.</p>
<p>The C programming language was <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20180115112144/http://groups.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/c/c.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">based on</a> the earlier programming languages B, BCPL, and CPL.</p>
<p>The C language and its optional library are standardized as ISO/IEC 9899, the current version being ISO/IEC 9899:2018 (C17). A draft version <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20181230041359/http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/abq/c17_updated_proposed_fdis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">N2176</a> is available for free.</p>
<p>Although C was designed for implementing system software, it is also widely used for developing portable application software.</p>
<p>C is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time and there are very few computer architectures for which a C compiler does not exist. C has greatly influenced many other popular programming languages, most notably C++, which began as an extension to C. Other languages that have been greatly influenced by C are C#, Objective-C and Java.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>C is an imperative (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">procedural</a>) systems implementation language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. C was, therefore, useful for many applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language.</p>
<p>Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant and portably written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with very few changes to its source code. The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.</p>

Pre-standard, historical questions should be tagged <a href=""/questions/tagged/kr-c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;kr-c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">kr-c</a>.</li>
<li>Unless the question explicitly mentions which version of the C standard that is used, it is assumed that the current version is used. That is, whichever version of ISO 9899 that ISO currently lists as active.

<p>C and C++ are two distinct and often incompatible languages. Avoid
using both tags in the same question unless you have good reasons.</p>
<p>A question should be tagged with <a href=""/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> only, if:</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains pure C, with no trace of C++, or questions with code that could be either language.</li>
<li>The code is compiled with a C compiler.</li>
</ul>
<p>A question should be tagged with <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a> only, if:</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains code with <em>any</em> C++ features. Even though the code may be &quot;C style&quot;.</li>
<li>The code is compiled with a C++ compiler.</li>
</ul>
<p>A question should be tagged with both <a href=""/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a> if it is about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific differences between C and C++.</li>

<h3>Editing and moderation guidelines for posts with both <a href=""/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a> tags:</h3>
<p>To edit/re-tag/moderate questions with both tags, it is recommended that you have full edit privileges and either a gold <a href=""/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> or a gold <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a> badge.</p>
<p>If you encounter a post with both tags, edit/re-tag it if needed according to the above rules. If you can tell the language by reading the posted code, simply edit tags accordingly. Avoid prompting the user &quot;is it C or C++?&quot; in comments unless the question is truly unclear.</p>
<p>One example of an unclear question is when the user explicitly claims that they are programming in C, but posts code or compiler messages for C++. If so, prompt for clarification and close-vote as unclear.</p>
<p>&quot;Either C or C++ is fine&quot; opinions from the OP is a strong indication of a poor or unclear question. Answers may be very different depending on language picked. Prompt for clarification, close as unclear/too broad until the OP has clarified this.</p>
<p>Be careful about re-tagging questions once there are answers posted, particularly if there are already both C and C++ answers posted. In such cases, the tags should be left alone, since changing them would make posted answers invalid.</p>
<p>Answers with C++ code to a C question that has never been tagged <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a> should be deleted as off-topic. Please check the question edit history before flagging/deleting such answers, to verify that the question never had the C++ tag.</p>

"5","3607014","","","<p><a href=""https://www.python.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Python</strong></a> is an <em>interpreted</em>, <em>interactive, object-oriented (using <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">classes</a>)</em>, <a href=""https://wiki.python.org/moin/Why%20is%20Python%20a%20dynamic%20language%20and%20also%20a%20strongly%20typed%20language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dynamic and strongly typed</a> programming language that is used for <a href=""https://www.python.org/about/apps"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a wide range of applications</a>. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high-level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in <a href=""/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> or <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a>. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later.</p>
<p>The language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files), Internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP, and CGI programming), software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, and parsing Python code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, and TCP/IP sockets). Look at the table of contents for <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Python Standard Library</a> to get an idea of whatâs available. A wide variety of third-party extensions are also available. Consult the <a href=""https://pypi.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Python Package Index</a> to find packages of interest to you.</p>
<p>Python allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in many other languages, such as C, and the language has constructs intended to be used to create clear programs in a variety of domains.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Python program</strong></p>
<pre><code>print(&quot;Hello, Stack Overflow!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p><em>versus</em></p>
<p><strong>C program</strong></p>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void) {
    printf(&quot;Hello, Stack Overflow!&quot;);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Python was originally created by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Guido van Rossum</strong></a> and first released in 1991. Guido Van Rossum chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).</p>
<p>Python 2 (16 October 2000 - 01 January 2020) <a href=""https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">has officially been sunset</a>, and Python 3 (3 December 2008) is the only supported, maintained and improved major version as of 01 January 2020. We have a community of people from both worlds, and if you have a question that relates to a specific version, please consider mentioning the version and implementation that you are using, when asking a question about Python (see <strong>Tagging Recommendation</strong> section below).</p>
<p>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to that of Scheme, Ruby, Perl, and Tcl.</p>
<p>Like other <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dynamic languages</a>, Python is often used as a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/scripting/info"">scripting language</a> but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CPython</a>, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open-source software. It has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. There are a wide variety of implementations more suited for specific environments or tasks (see <a href=""https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonImplementations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Python implementations</a> on the Python wiki).</p>
<p>The philosophy of Python is succinctly formulated in <a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Zen of Python</em></a>, written by Tim Peters, which one can read by issuing this command, in the interactive python interpreter:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import this
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike many other languages, Python uses an indentation-based syntax (in which tabs and spaces are noninterchangeable). This may take some getting used to for programmers who are familiar with using braces.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from __future__ import braces
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
SyntaxError: not a chance
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To help with the transition, using a properly configured text-editor or IDE is recommended. Python comes with a basic IDE called <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/idle.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IDLE</a> (<a href=""/questions/tagged/python-idle"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python-idle&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python-idle</a>), to get you started. Other popular examples are the charityware Vim, the free GNU Emacs, Eclipse+PyDev, or PyCharm. Take a look at this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_integrated_development_environments_for_Python#Python"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IDE comparison list</a> for many other alternatives.</p>
<p>There is also a style guide for Python, named <a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PEP 8</a>, which aims to make Python code more readable and consistent. This guide is (should be) followed all across the Python development community.</p>

<h2>Tagging Recommendation:</h2>
<p>Use the <a href=""/questions/tagged/python"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python</a> tag, for all Python-related questions. If you believe your question includes issues specific to individual versions, use <a href=""/questions/tagged/python-3.x"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python-3.x&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python-3.x</a> or <a href=""/questions/tagged/python-2.7"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python-2.7&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python-2.7</a>, in addition to the main <a href=""/questions/tagged/python"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python</a> tag. If you believe your question maybe even more specific, you can include a version-specific tag such as <a href=""/questions/tagged/python-3.5"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python-3.5&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python-3.5</a> or <a href=""/questions/tagged/python-3.6"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python-3.6&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python-3.6</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Also, consider including the tag for the specific implementation (<a href=""/questions/tagged/jython"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;jython&#39;"" rel=""tag"">jython</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/pypy"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;pypy&#39;"" rel=""tag"">pypy</a>, etc.), if you are using one other than <a href=""/questions/tagged/cpython"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cpython&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cpython</a> â the use of <a href=""/questions/tagged/cpython"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cpython&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cpython</a> is assumed unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>

The post also contains links to many popular online regular expression testers (where the meanings of regex constructs can be found). One such tool is <a href=""https://regex101.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Regex101</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Regular expressions</a> are a powerful formalism for pattern matching in strings. They are available in a variety of dialects (also known as <em>flavors</em>) in a number of programming languages and text-processing tools, as well as many specialized applications.  The term &quot;Regular expression&quot; is typically abbreviated as &quot;RegEx&quot; or &quot;regex&quot;.</p>
<p>Before asking a question here, please take the time to review the following brief guidelines.</p>
<h2>How To Ask</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Be clear about what you need</strong>.</p>
<p>Always indicate which platform you need or want to use (programming language, tool, occasionally even version information).  Keep in mind that regex dialects are different; the lowest common denominator will usually be quite different from what is possible and recommended for a tool with a modern, souped-up regex engine.</p>
<p>Also, are you looking for a regular expression for input validation (which needs to be rather strict), or do you need one for information extraction (which can be somewhat relaxed)?</p>
<p>If your question relates to regular expressions in the strict computer science/automata theory sense, please state this explicitly.</p>
<p>For most other questions, you should always include sample input, expected output, and an outline of what you have tried, and where you are stuck.  Often, an example of what you do <em>not</em> want to match is also very helpful, and important to know.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Show us what you tried.</strong></p>
<p>A link to one of the many online regex testing tools (see link section) with your attempt and some representative data can do wonders.</p>
<p>Even if you cannot post your problem online, showing us your best attempt helps us focus on what you need help with.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Search for duplicates</strong>.</p>
<p>Before posting, check if your issue has already been solved by somebody else asking something similar. The following section outlines some common recurring topics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Avoid Common Problems and Pitfalls</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Do not assume that the tool you are using supports precisely the syntax of another tool</strong>.</p>
<p>While modern Perl/Ruby/Python/PHP/Java regular expression support is widespread, you cannot assume that it is universal.  In particular, many older tools (Awk, <code>sed</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>lex</code>, etc.), as well as some newer ones (JavaScript, many text editors), use different dialects, some of which do not necessarily support e.g. non-capturing parentheses <code>(?:...)</code>, non-greedy quantifiers <code>*?</code>, backreferences (<code>\1</code>, <code>\2</code>, etc), common character class abbreviations (<code>\t</code>, <code>\d</code>, POSIX character classes <code>[[:class:]]</code>), arbitrary repetition <code>{m,n}</code>, lookaheads <code>(?=...)</code>, <code>(?&lt;=...)</code>, <code>(?!...)</code>, etc. etc.</p>
<p>If your question is not specific to any particular implementation, try the <a href=""/questions/tagged/language-agnostic"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;language-agnostic&#39;"" rel=""tag"">language-agnostic</a> tag. This will generally imply a fairly minimal set of operators, corresponding to the ones specified in the common mathematical definition of regular languages.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Understand the difference between &quot;glob&quot; expressions and true regular expressions</strong>.</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Glob patterns</a> are a less potent pattern matching language, which is commonly used for file name wildcards. In glob, <code>*</code> means &quot;anything&quot;, while a lone <code>*</code> in a regular expression is, in fact, a syntax error in some dialects (though many engines will silently ignore it, rather than issue a warning; and others still will see it as a literal <code>*</code>).</p>
<p>For the record, the regex way to say (as much as possible of) &quot;anything&quot; is <code>.*</code> where the &quot;any single character (except newline, usually)&quot; <code>.</code> metacharacter is repeated zero or more times (<code>*</code>). But see below about how &quot;any character&quot; and greediness is often problematic.</p>
<p>See also <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23702202/what-are-the-differences-between-glob-style-pattern-and-regular-expression"">What are the differences between glob-style pattern and regular expression?</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Specifying a single repetition is unnecessary</strong>.</p>
<p>Using <code>{1}</code> as a single-repetition quantifier is harmless but never useful. It is basically an indication of inexperience and/or confusion.</p>
<p><code>h{1}t{1}t{1}p{1}</code> matches the same string as the simpler expression <code>http</code> (or <code>ht{2}p</code> for that matter) but as you can see, the redundant <code>{1}</code> repetitions only make it harder to read.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Square brackets are commonly misunderstood or misused</strong>.</p>
<p>Beginners often attempt to use square brackets for everything, including grouping. While <code>[Jun][Jul]</code> may <em>look</em> like a regex for matching months, it actually matches <code>JJ</code>, <code>Ju</code>, <code>Jl</code>, <code>uJ</code>, <code>uu</code>, <code>ul</code>, <code>nJ</code>, <code>nu</code>, or <code>nl</code>; not <code>Jun</code> or <code>Jul</code>. <code>[Jun|Jul]</code> is a wasteful way to write the functionally identical <code>[|Junl]</code>âit matches any one character from the set comprising <code>|</code>, <code>J</code>, <code>u</code>, <code>l</code>, and <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>For the record, <code>[abc]</code> defines a <em>character class</em>  which matches a single character which can be <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> or <code>c</code>. The proper way to express alternation is <code>(Jun|Jul|Aug)</code> in many dialects (though <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#POSIX_Basic_Regular_Expressions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BRE</a> and related dialects will need backslashes; <code>\(Jun\|Jul\|Aug\)</code> for traditional <code>grep</code> et al.) or, somewhat more parsimoniously, <code>(Ju[nl]|Aug)</code></p>
<p>See also <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9801630/what-is-the-difference-between-square-brackets-and-parentheses-in-a-regex"">What is the difference between square brackets and parentheses in a regex?</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Negation is tricky</strong>.</p>
<p>Related to the previous, beginners will use negated character classes to attempt to restrict what can be matched. For example, to match <code>turn</code> but not <code>turned</code>, the following <strong>does not do what you want:</strong> <code>turn[^ed]</code> -- it will match <code>turn</code> followed by any single character which is not <code>e</code> or <code>d</code> (so it will not match <code>turner</code>, for example).</p>
<p>In fact, the traditional regex does not allow for this to be expressed easily. With ERE, you could say <code>turn($|[^e]|e$|e[^d])</code> to say that <code>turn</code> can be followed by nothing, or a character which is not <code>e</code>, or by <code>e</code> if it is not in turn followed by <code>d</code>. Modern regular expression dialects have an extension called <em>lookarounds</em> which allow you to say <code>turn(?!ed)</code>âbut make sure your tool supports this syntax before plunging ahead.</p>
<p>Notice also how the character class negation operator is distinct from the beginning of line anchor (<code>^[abc]</code> matches <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, or <code>c</code> at beginning of the line, whereas <code>[^abc]</code> matches a single character which is not <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, or <code>c</code>).</p>
<p>See also the next bullet point.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>If there is a way to match, the engine will find it</strong>.</p>
<p>A common beginner's mistake is to supply useless optional leading or trailing elements. The trailing <code>s?</code> in <code>dogs?</code> does nothing to prevent a match on <code>doggone</code> or <code>endogenous</code>. If you want to prevent those, you will need to elaborateâperhaps something like <code>dogs?\&gt;</code> (provided your dialect supports the final word boundary operator and provided that's what you mean).</p>
<p>As it is, the regular expression <code>dogs?</code> will match exactly the same strings as just <code>dog</code> (though if your application captures the match, only the former will capture a trailing <code>s</code> if there is one).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Matches are greedy</strong>.</p>
<p>The regex <code>a.*b</code> will match the entire string &quot;abbbbbb&quot; because <code>*</code> will always match as much as possible. Say <code>a[^ab]*b</code> if that's what you mean, or use non-greedy matching if your dialect supports it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Watch what you capture</strong></p>
<p>If you use grouping parentheses, the parentheses define what is captured into a backreference.  If you edit in parentheses for grouping purposes, make sure you are not renumbering your backreferences.</p>
<p>Also, in particular, watch out for <code>(abc){2,3}</code> which only captures the <em>last</em> occurrence of <code>abc</code> in the matched string.  If you want the repetition to be part of the capture, it needs to be inside the parentheses, like this: <code>((abc){2,3})</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Don't use regex for everything!</strong></p>
<p>In particular, using (typically line-oriented) traditional regex tools to handle structured formats like HTML, XML, JSON, configuration files with block structure (Apache, nginx, many name servers, etc.) is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/590747/using-regular-expressions-to-parse-html-why-not"">likely to fail, or to produce incorrect results in numerous corner cases</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Asking for HTML regexes</strong> tends to be <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454?s=1%7C8.3201#1732454"">met with negative reactions</a>. The reasoning extends to all structured formats. If there is a parser for it, use that instead.</p>

<h2>Regex Uses:</h2>
<p>Regular expressions are useful in a wide variety of text processing tasks, and more generally string processing, where the data need not be textual. Common applications include data validation, data scraping (especially web scraping), data wrangling, simple parsing, the production of syntax highlighting systems, and many other tasks.</p>
<p>While regular expressions would be useful on Internet search engines, processing them across the entire database could consume excessive computer resources depending on the complexity and design of the regex. Although in many cases system administrators can run regex-based queries internally, most search engines do not offer regex support to the public. Notable exceptions: searchcode, or previously <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7778034/replacement-for-google-code-search"">Google Code Search, which has been shut down in 2012</a>.<br />
Google also offers <strong><a href=""https://github.com/google/re2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">re2</a></strong> (a C++ a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python): it does not backtrack and guarantees linear runtime growth with input size.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.java.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Java</a> is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">high-level</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">platform-independent</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">object-oriented</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">functional</a> programming language and runtime environment.</p>
<p>The Java language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but its object model is simpler than that of the latter and it has fewer low-level facilities. Java applications are typically compiled to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bytecode</a> (called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_class_file"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">class files</a>) that can be executed by a JVM (Java Virtual Machine), independent of computer architecture. The JVM often further compiles code to native machine code to optimize performance.</p>
<p>The JVM manages memory with the help of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">garbage collector</a> (see also <a href=""/questions/tagged/garbage-collection"">garbage-collection</a>) to handle object removal from memory when objects are no longer in use. Java's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">typing discipline</a> is static, strong, safe, nominative, and manifest. Java supports features such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reflection</a> and interfacing with C and C++ via the JNI (Java Native Interface).</p>
<p>Java is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, intended to allow application developers to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>write once, run anywhere</em></a>, or sometimes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_everywhere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>write once, run everywhere</em></a> (code that executes on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another). Java was originally developed by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">James Gosling</a> at Sun Microsystems (which fully merged with Oracle Corporation on January 27th, 2010) and was released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. Java was started as a project called &quot;Oak&quot; by James Gosling in June 1991.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/The_Java_Platform"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Java platform</a> is the name given by Sun (now Oracle) to computing systems that have installed tools for developing and running Java programs. The platform features a wide variety of tools that can help developers work efficiently with the Java programming language.</p>
<p>To get started, you download a <strong>Java Development Kit (JDK)</strong>, which lets you both <em>develop</em> and <em>run</em> java applications.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The main reference implementation of Java is open source (the <a href=""https://openjdk.java.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenJDK</a>) and is supported by major companies including Oracle, Apple, SAP, and IBM.</p>
<p>Very few computers can run Java programs directly. Java software often runs on servers. Java apps intended to run directly on client computers should ship with their own installers. (NB: Before java9, you asked end-users to install a so-called JRE; however, this concept has been deprecated).</p>
<p>Java is compiled into <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bytecode</a>, which is then compiled by the JVM into native machine code. The compilation is done <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">just-in-time</a> (JIT). This was initially viewed as a performance hit, but JVM and JIT compilation improvements have made this less of a concern. In some cases, the JVM may even be faster than native code compiled to target an older version of a processor for backward compatibility reasons. Since Java 9, it can be compiled <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ahead-of-time</a> (AOT).</p>

To see release notes for each version of the JDK, visit the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article</a> on Java version history.</p>
<p>To get a Java JDK so you can develop (or run) java code on your machine, you need a <em>java installer package supplier</em>. Java is open source, but a supplier will take care of building the java source code into a binary, wrapping this into an installer, and maintaining this version on your machine (e.g. with security updates).</p>
<p>Java comes in LTS (Long-Term-Support) and non-LTS versions. Each supplier chooses how to deal with LTS versions. Some (Oracle OpenJDK) have the same short support window for all releases, LTS or not. Some (Amazon Corretto) do not bother to release non-LTS versions at all. Most suppliers release all versions that will support LTS versions for far longer.</p>
<p>The LTS versions are- Java 8, 11, and 17.</p>
<p>The major suppliers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://adoptopenjdk.net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AdoptOpenJDK</a>, also known as Adoptium - free, LTS versions and non-LTS versions, LTS versions are supported a long time. Recommended.</li>
<li><a href=""https://jdk.java.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oracle OpenJDK</a> - Note that these are <strong>only supported for 6 months</strong>, even the so-called LTS (Long Term Support) releases. You will need to update as java updates.</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oracle JavaSE</a> - licensed for those who want commercial support. LTS and non-LTS versions, LTS versions are supported for a long time. A free but license-wise very restricted test version is available.</li>
<li><a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Amazon Coretto</a> - free, maintained by Amazon, optimized for AWS, LTS versions only.</li>
<li>Many more commercial offerings.</li>
</ul>

</div><h2>Initial help</h2>
<p>New to Java or need help to get your first Java program running? See the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oracle Java Tutorials section on Getting Started</a>.</p>
<p>Before asking a question, please search to see if it has been asked before (we have many duplicates, some are listed below under <strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong>), and read <a href=""https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Writing the Perfect Question</a> to learn how to get Jon Skeet to answer your question.</p>
<h2>Naming conventions</h2>
<p>Java programs should adhere to the following <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-6.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">naming conventions</a> to increase readability and decrease the chances of accidental errors. By following these naming conventions, you will make it easier for others to understand your code and help you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type names</strong> (classes, interfaces, enums, etc.) should begin with a capital letter and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. Examples include: <code>String</code>, <code>ThreadLocal</code>, and <code>NullPointerException</code>. This is sometimes known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PascalCase"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PascalCase</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Method and field names</strong> should be camelCased; that is, they should begin with a lowercase letter and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. Examples: <code>indexOf</code>, <code>printStackTrace</code>, <code>interrupt</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Constant expression names</strong> (<code>static final</code> immutable objects) should be written in ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE, with underscores separating each word. Examples: <code>YELLOW</code>, <code>DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE</code>. This also applies to the values of an <code>Enum</code> class. However, <code>static final</code> references to <em>non</em>-immutable objects should be camelCased.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hello World - Your first program</h2>
<p>Code of a typical <strong>Hello World</strong> program:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Compilation and invocation of <strong>Hello World</strong> program:</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>javac -d . HelloWorld.java
java -cp . HelloWorld
</code></pre>
<p>Java source code is compiled to an intermediate form (bytecode instructions for the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Java Virtual Machine</a>) which can be executed with the <code>java</code> command later on.</p>

"5","3607030","","","<p><strong>How to write a good SQL Server question</strong></p>
<p>There are six ingredients to this recipe:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide a clear textual explanation of the problem at hand.</li>
<li>Provide proper sample data, as <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DDL</a> (Create table statement(s)) and <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/editions.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DML</a> (Insert statement(s)). The sample data should be enough to demonstrate the problem, including edge cases. Usually, a few relevant rows are enough. (You can use <a href=""http://sqlfiddle.com/#!18"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SQLFiddle</a> or <a href=""https://www.db-fiddle.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">db-fiddle</a> as an online tool to generate DDL and DML statements for you from tabular data using their Text To DDL button.)</li>
<li>Provide expected output for the sample data you've posted.</li>
<li>Show your attempts to solve the problem.</li>
<li>Tag properly. In addition to <a href=""/questions/tagged/sql-server"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sql-server&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sql-server</a>, also provide the tag for the lowest version you need the solution for.
(I.e., if you're developing on SQL Server 2016, but the production
server is SQL Server 2012, use <a href=""/questions/tagged/sql-server-2012"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sql-server-2012&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sql-server-2012</a>.)</li>
<li>Do not include images of data or code!</li>
</ol>
<p>A link to an online SQL test environment such as SQL Fiddle or DB Fiddle might help, but it is not a replacement for having all the data inside the question.</p>
<p>For more information, read <em><a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/333952/why-should-i-provide-an-mcve-for-what-seems-to-me-to-be-a-very-simple-sql-query"">Why should I provide an MCVE for what seems to me to be a very simple SQL query?</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://dba.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2976/help-me-write-this-query-in-sql"">Help me write this query in SQL</a></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Questions about performance tuning</strong> should include, along with all of the above, the execution plan of the query. (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7359702/how-do-i-obtain-a-query-execution-plan"">How do I obtain a Query Execution Plan?</a>). You can paste the execution plan on <a href=""https://www.brentozar.com/pastetheplan/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brent Ozar's Paste The Plan</a> and share a link to it in the question.</p>
<p><strong>General Information:</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft's <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SQL Server</a> is a suite of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em><strong>relational database management system</strong></em></a> (RDBMS) products providing multi-user database access functionality. It originated from the Sybase SQL Server 4.x codebase and <em>Transact-SQL dialect</em> (<a href=""/questions/tagged/t-sql"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;t-sql&#39;"" rel=""tag"">t-sql</a>), but it has forked significantly since then.</p>
<p>SQL Server is available in multiple versions (typically identified by release year), each of which are subdivided into <em>editions</em> to distinguish between product functionality. The latest released version is <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SQL Server 2019</a> which was released on November 4th, 2019.</p>
<p>The SQL Server product range is split broadly into six categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/features.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>SQL Server</strong></a> (<a href=""/questions/tagged/sql-server"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sql-server&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sql-server</a>) is the main suite of enterprise and developer server products. The primary differences are licensing costs, capacities, and components included in the product, with some minor differences supported language features. Standard components include database language and storage server, developer tools, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ETL</a> tools (<a href=""/questions/tagged/ssis"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ssis&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ssis</a>), schedulers, and replication. Other components include OLAP (<a href=""/questions/tagged/ssas"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ssas&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ssas</a>), reporting (<a href=""/questions/tagged/reporting-services"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reporting-services&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reporting-services</a>), and parallel computation. Components runs as NT Services.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server-editions/sql-server-express.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>SQL Server Express</strong></a> (<a href=""/questions/tagged/sql-server-express"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sql-server-express&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sql-server-express</a>) is free for use and distribution, but it has reduced engine performance, functionality and capacity than found in its other server siblings. It is focused on small deployments and runs as an NT service.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>SQL Server Compact Edition</strong> (<a href=""/questions/tagged/sql-server-ce"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sql-server-ce&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sql-server-ce</a>) is an embeddable subset of SQL Server. Like the Express edition it has a reduced language, functionality and capacity, but it is free to distribute. It's focused on small installations and desktop applications where its small footprint and no-management-required features are a great advantage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note: SQL Server Compact Edition <a href=""https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/776328/port-sql-compact-to-windows-rt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">is deprecated</a></strong>. Customers should use SQL Server Express and <a href=""https://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlexpress/archive/2011/07/12/introducing-localdb-a-better-sql-express.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">possibly LocalDB</a>).</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li><p><a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Azure SQL Database</strong></a> (<a href=""/questions/tagged/sql-azure"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sql-azure&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sql-azure</a>) is a completely managed, hosted, high-availability product with similar features to SQL Server, operated in <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft Azure</a> data centers. Notable <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/sql-database-transact-sql-information/?TrackId=717835e702e2482ea01bb8cb1ef4d881&amp;ms.original.contentid=ee336281&amp;ms.original.locale=en-us"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">differences</a> are language syntax support for federated queries, and lack of support for CLR integration.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/analytics-platform-system/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>SQL Server Analytics Platform System</strong></a> (or <strong>APS</strong>), formerly known as <strong>SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse</strong> (<strong>PDW</strong>), is a pre-built data warehouse appliance that offers massively parallel processing for SQL Server, allowing support for many hundreds of terabytes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://aka.ms/sqldw/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Azure SQL Data Warehouse</strong></a> is an enterprise-class distributed database in the Azure Cloud capable of processing up to petabyte volumes of relational and non-relational data. It is the industry's first cloud data warehouse with grow, shrink, and pause in seconds.</p>

"5","3607050","","","<p><strong><a href=""https://php.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PHP</a></strong> is a widely used, open source, general-purpose, multi-paradigm, dynamically typed and interpreted scripting language originally designed for server-side web development.</p>
<p>The original PHP project, as invented by Rasmus Lerdorf, stood for <em>Personal Home Page</em>. Today, it stands for the recursive acronym <em>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</em>.</p>
<p>The latest stable release, development changes, and development branches can be found on <a href=""https://php.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the PHP website</a>, and the source code, written in C, is available at PHP's <a href=""https://github.com/php/php-src/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>To create an environment for learning and experimenting with PHP, there are a number of application bundles that include â among other components â a web server and PHP:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://ampps.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AMPPS</a></li>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.cygwin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cygwin</a> (Linux on Windows)</li>
</ul>
<p>PHP provides a built-in web server for testing and development purposes. It can be started using the following command:</p>
<pre><code> php -S localhost:8000
</code></pre>
<p>After executing the above command, the server will listen on port <code>8000</code> using the current working directory as its document root. See the <a href=""https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PHP manual</a> for more information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notice:</strong> To make an online demo for your question, you may use <a href=""http://codepad.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>codepad</strong></a>, <a href=""https://3v4l.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""3v4l""><strong>3v4l</strong></a>, or <a href=""http://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>PHP Sandbox</strong></a>. However, all relevant code should still be included in your question or answer.</p>

<h2>Sample PHP script</h2>
<p>This script displays <code>Hello World!</code> on your screen.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
   echo 'Hello World!';
?&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To run this script in a console, save it in the current working directory in a file called <code>hello.php</code> and simply execute the command: <code>php hello.php</code>.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>

<h2>Database support</h2>
<p>PHP supports a wide range of databases, <a href=""https://php.net/refs.database"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">relational and non-relational alike</a>.</p>
<p>PHP is often paired with the <a href=""https://php.net/mysqli"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MySQL</a> relational database. PHP also includes great database support for <a href=""https://php.net/pgsql"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href=""https://php.net/sqlite3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SQLite</a>, <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2005/en/us/PHP-Driver.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft SQL Server</a> (<a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc296152(SQL.90).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">API reference</a>), <a href=""https://php.net/oci8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oracle</a>, <a href=""https://php.net/ibm-db2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IBM DB2 &amp; Cloudscape, Apache Derby</a>, and even <a href=""https://php.net/uodbc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ODBC</a>.</p>
<p>All modern versions of PHP include <a href=""https://php.net/pdo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PDO</a>: a built-in <a href=""https://php.net/intro.pdo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">data-access abstraction library</a> with <a href=""https://php.net/pdo.drivers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">comprehensive connectivity options</a>.  More recently, PECL extensions that offer &quot;NoSQL&quot; database support have surfaced, including <a href=""https://github.com/mjpearson/Pandra/tree/master/lib/thrift/ext/thrift_protocol/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Apache Thrift</a> (for <a href=""https://cassandra.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Apache Cassandra</a>), <a href=""https://php.net/mongo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MongoDB</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/owlient/phpredis/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Redis</a>, and others.</p>
<h2>Useful Third-party Code and Tools</h2>
<p>In addition to the vast functionality provided in the PHP Core and through PEAR and PECL, there are a number of noteworthy third-party contributions to the PHP world, some of which are listed below:</p>
<h3>Package Management with Composer</h3>
<p><a href=""https://getcomposer.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Composer</a> is a package management tool for PHP inspired by npm for Node.js and Bundler for Ruby. It allows for per-project dependencies to be specified in a JSON file.</p>
<p>Composer uses packages from <a href=""https://packagist.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Packagist</a> which is rapidly growing to contain many of the most popular PHP libraries.</p>
<p>Composer solves the following problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have a project that depends on a number of libraries.</li>
<li>Some of those libraries depend on other libraries.</li>
<li>You declare the things you depend on.</li>
<li>Composer determines which versions of which packages need to be installed and downloads them into a directory (usually <code>vendor</code>) in your project.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Nothing comes for free. Software downloaded with Composer may have bugs, just like any other, including security vulnerabilities. It is your responsibility to be aware of what you install and to update when necessary in order to get security fixes.</em></p>

<h2>Coding standards and conventions</h2>
<p>There are a number of coding standards that have been proposed and accepted by the <a href=""https://www.php-fig.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PHP Framework Interop Group (PHP-FIG)</a>. These are known as the <strong>PHP Standards Recommendations (PSRs)</strong>. As of July 2nd, 2017, the following recommendations are in effect:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PSR-1 - Basic Coding Standard</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PSR-3 - Logger interface</a></li>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JavaScript</a></strong> (a dialect of ECMAScript) is a high-level, dynamic, multi-paradigm, object-oriented, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">prototype-based</a>, weakly-typed, and interpreted language traditionally used for client-side scripting in web browsers.

<li>If the issue is client-side, mention which browser the code is having problems on, and what error messages, if any, were thrown by the browser.  Use the Developer Tools for your browser (see &quot;Useful Tools&quot; below) to see these messages.

<li>Only tag the question as <a href=""/questions/tagged/css"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;css&#39;"" rel=""tag"">css</a> or <a href=""/questions/tagged/html"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;html&#39;"" rel=""tag"">html</a> if you are asking about an issue that concerns the combination of one of those with JavaScript and could only be answered with information specifically regarding either of those subjects.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: Unless a tag for a framework or library is also included, a pure JavaScript answer is expected for questions with the <a href=""/questions/tagged/javascript"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;"" rel=""tag"">javascript</a> tag.</em></p>
<h2>About JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript runs on nearly every operating system, and an engine is included in mainstream web browsers. Developed in 1995 by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brendan Eich</a> at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Netscape Communications</a>, it was originally called <a href=""https://livescript.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LiveScript</a> but was renamed to JavaScript due to Netscape's friendly relationship with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sun Microsystems</a> (creators of <a href=""https://www.java.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Java"">Java</a>) at the time.</p>
<p>Standalone JavaScript engines or interpreters are available as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla's Spidermonkey, the first JavaScript engine ever written, currently used in Mozilla Firefox.</li>
<li>Google's JavaScript engine, Chrome V8, used in Google Chrome and Chromium.</li>
<li>Google Apps Script, a cloud-based/server-side interpreter that provides programmatic &quot;macro-like&quot; control of Google Apps services and documents.</li>
<li>Node.js, built on top of V8, a platform that enables server-side applications to be written in JavaScript.</li>
<li>Windows includes JScript, a JavaScript variant in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Script_Host"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows Script Host</a>.</li>
<li>Chakra, a fork of JScript, is developed by Microsoft and used in Edge.</li>
<li>Mozilla also offers Rhino, implementation of JavaScript built-in Java, typically embedded into Java applications to provide scripting to end-users.</li>
<li>WebKit (except for the Chromium project) implements the JavaScriptCore engine.</li>
<li>ActionScript (originally derived from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HyperTalk</a>) is now an ECMAScript dialect and uses a lot of ECMAScript APIs.</li>
<li><a href=""http://duktape.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Duktape Embeddable</a>, a portable ECMAScript engine in C with a small memory footprint.</li>
<li><a href=""https://wakanda.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wakanda</a>, a framework, IDE, and Server built on V8 supporting server-side JavaScript</li>
<li>Meteor: a Meteor application is a mix of client-side JavaScript that runs inside a web browser or PhoneGap mobile app, server-side JavaScript that runs on the Meteor server inside a Node.js container. (according to <a href=""https://docs.meteor.com/#/full/resources"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MeteorJS documentation</a>)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashorn_(JavaScript_engine)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nashorn</a>, a JavaScript engine developed in the Java programming language, based on the Da Vinci Machine (JSR 292)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mozilla Developer Network</a> contains high-quality <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation on JavaScript</a>.</p>
<p>JavaScript is typically used to manipulate the <a href=""https://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Document Object Model</a> (DOM) and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS) within the browser. This allows user interface scripting, animation, automation, client-side validation, and much more.</p>
<p>With the recent emergence of platforms such as <a href=""https://nodejs.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Node.js</a>, JavaScript can now be used to write server-side applications. In addition, it is also used in environments that aren't web-based, like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PDF documents</a>, site-specific browsers, desktop widgets, etc.</p>
<h3>Nomenclature</h3>
<p>Although it was developed under the name <strong>Mocha</strong>, the language was officially called LiveScript when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript when it was deployed in the Netscape browser version 2.0B3.</p>
<p><strong>The change of name from LiveScript to JavaScript roughly coincided with Netscape adding support for Java technology in its Netscape Navigator web browser</strong>. The final choice of name caused confusion, giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot, new web-programming language.</p>
<p>People often use the term <em>JavaScript</em> informally. The language and the term originated from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Netscape</a>. <strong>ECMAScript</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>JScript</strong> are terms that are easy to confuse.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ECMAScript</a></strong> was developed as a standardization of Netscape's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JavaScript</a> and Microsoft's independently-developed <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yek4tbz0.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JScript</a>. The canonical reference is the <a href=""https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ECMAScriptÂ® 2015 Language Specification</a>. While JavaScript and JScript aim to be compatible with ECMAScript, they also provide additional features (and <a href=""https://regmedia.co.uk/2007/10/31/jscriptdeviationsfromes3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">other deviations</a>) not described in the ECMA specifications. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#Dialects"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Other implementations</a> of ECMAScript also exist.</p>
<p>The differences today for those who use JavaScript are negligible; people generally do not distinguish the JavaScript and JScript variations from ECMAScript.</p>
<h3>ECMAScript versions</h3>
<p>Most modern browsers implement JavaScript based on the ECMAScript 6 specification, although some fail to implement some ES6 features. However, older browsers such as Internet Explorer 8 implement the ECMAScript 3 specification, which does not contain functions such as <code>Function.prototype.bind</code>, and even <code>JSON.parse</code>, among others. You can see the <a href=""https://caniuse.com/es6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">current browser support</a> of ES6 features</p>
<p>The current version of ECMAScript is ECMAScript 12, properly known as ECMAScript 2021, which was published in June 2021.</p>
<h3>Example JavaScript code</h3>
<p>This script displays &quot;Hello World&quot; on your screen.</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>window.onload = function() {
   alert('Hello World!');
};
</code></pre>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors contain this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.</p>
<p><strong>Content Security Policy</strong> is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a Web page.</p>
<p>XSS is a frequent type of attempting to steal data or harm a website via JavaScript.</p>

"5","3607053","","","<h2>About</h2>
<p><a href=""https://jquery.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jQuery (Core)</a> is a cross-browser JavaScript library (created by <a href=""https://johnresig.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">John Resig</a>) that provides abstractions for common client-side tasks such as <a href=""http://javascript.info/tutorial/traversing-dom"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DOM traversal</a>, DOM manipulation, event handling, animation and AJAX.</p>
<p>jQuery simplifies HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and AJAX due to its API that works across a multitude of browsers.</p>
<p>jQuery provides a platform to create plugins that extend its capabilities beyond those already provided by the library. The development of jQuery and related projects is coordinated by the <a href=""https://jquery.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jQuery Foundation</a>.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>jQuery includes the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>DOM element selections using the multi-browser open source selector engine Sizzle, a spin-off of the jQuery project</li>
<li>DOM traversal and modification (including support for CSS 1â3)</li>
<li>DOM manipulation based on CSS selectors that use node element names and attributes (e.g. <code>ID</code> and <code>class</code>) as criteria to build selectors</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Effects and animations</li>
<li>AJAX</li>
<li>JSON parsing (for older browsers)</li>
<li>Extensibility through plug-ins</li>
<li>Utilities such as user agent information, feature detection</li>
<li>Compatibility methods that are natively available in modern browsers but need fallbacks for older ones - For example the <code>inArray()</code> and <code>each()</code> functions</li>
<li>Multi-browser (not to be confused with cross-browser) support</li>
</ul>
<h2>Browser Support</h2>
<p><a href=""https://jquery.com/browser-support/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jQuery supports</a> the current stable version, and the preceding version or &quot;current - 1 version,&quot; of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari. It also supports the current stable version of Opera.</p>
<p>In addition, jQuery 1.x supports Internet Explorer version 6 or higher. However, support for IE 6-8 was dropped by <a href=""https://blog.jquery.com/2013/04/18/jquery-2-0-released/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jQuery 2.x</a> and by <a href=""https://blog.jquery.com/2016/06/09/jquery-3-0-final-released/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jQuery 3.x</a>, which support only IE 9 or higher.</p>
<p>Finally, jQuery supports the stock mobile browser on Android 4.0 and higher, and Safari on iOS 7 and higher.</p>
<h3>jQuery Versions</h3>
<p>jQuery is updated frequently, so the library should be used carefully. Some functions become deprecated with newer versions of jQuery. Follow the <a href=""https://blog.jquery.com/category/jquery/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">release notes</a> to be on track with the features.</p>
<p>The jQuery CDN provides download links for <a href=""https://code.jquery.com/jquery/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">all versions of jQuery</a>, including the <a href=""https://code.jquery.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">latest stable versions of each branch</a>.</p>
<h3>When asking jQuery related questions, you should:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read the <a href=""https://api.jquery.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jQuery API documentation</a> carefully and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search"">search Stack Overflow</a> for duplicates before asking.</li>
<li>Isolate the problematic code and reproduce it in an online environment such as <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JSFiddle</a>, <a href=""https://jsbin.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JSBin</a>, or <a href=""https://codepen.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CodePen</a>. For Live Connect you can also use <a href=""https://liveweave.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LiveWeave</a>. However, be sure to include the problematic code in your question â don't just link to the online environment. You can also use <a href=""https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/09/introducing-runnable-javascript-css-and-html-code-snippets/"">Stack Snippets</a> to include the runnable code in the question itself.</li>
<li>Tag the question appropriately; always include <a href=""/questions/tagged/jquery"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;jquery&#39;"" rel=""tag"">jquery</a>, and use the other web development tags (<a href=""/questions/tagged/html"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;html&#39;"" rel=""tag"">html</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/javascript"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;"" rel=""tag"">javascript</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/ajax"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ajax&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ajax</a>) as applicable. The most popular jQuery plugins also have their own tags, such as <a href=""/questions/tagged/jquery-ui"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;jquery-ui&#39;"" rel=""tag"">jquery-ui</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/jquery-mobile"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;jquery-mobile&#39;"" rel=""tag"">jquery-mobile</a>, and <a href=""/questions/tagged/jquery-validate"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;jquery-validate&#39;"" rel=""tag"">jquery-validate</a>; for every other plugin include the tag <a href=""/questions/tagged/jquery-plugins"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;jquery-plugins&#39;"" rel=""tag"">jquery-plugins</a>.</li>
<li>Indicate the version of the jQuery library used, so that any answers can provide version-appropriate solutions.</li>
<li>Mention which browser the code is having problems on and what error messages, if any, were thrown by the browser. If the problems are consistent in a cross-browser way, then that's valuable information too.</li>

<h2>Best practices and commonly made mistakes</h2>
<p>Related question: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1229259/jquery-pitfalls-to-avoid"">jQuery pitfalls to avoid</a></p>
<h3>Remember to use a ready handler</h3>
<p>If your code is somehow manipulating the DOM, then you need to ensure that it is run after the DOM finishes loading.</p>
<p>jQuery provides ways to do that with an anonymous function:</p>
<pre><code>$(function () { 
    /* code here */ 
});

// Or
$(document).ready(function () { 
    /* code here */ 
});
</code></pre>
<p>or with a named function:</p>
<pre><code>$(functionName);

// Or
$(document).ready(functionName);
</code></pre>
<p>These are alternatives to placing the JavaScript code or script tag in the HTML right before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<p>In jQuery 3.x, <a href=""https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#deprecated-document-ready-handlers-other-than-jquery-function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the recommended way to add a ready handler</a> is <code>$(function () {})</code>, while other forms such as <code>$(document).ready(function () {})</code> are deprecated. Also, <a href=""https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#breaking-change-on-quot-ready-quot-fn-removed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jQuery 3.x removes the ability to use</a> <code>.on(&quot;ready&quot;, function () {})</code> to run a function on the &quot;ready&quot; event.</p>
<h3>Avoid conflicts by using <code>noConflict()</code> and a different alias for jQuery</h3>
<p>If your jQuery code conflicts with another library that also uses the <code>$</code> sign as an alias, then use <a href=""http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/avoid-conflicts-other-libraries/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the <code>noConflict()</code> method</a>:</p>
<pre><code>jQuery.noConflict();
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can safely use <code>$</code> as an alias for the other library while using the name <code>jQuery</code> itself for jQuery functions.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can call</p>
<pre><code>$jq = jQuery.noConflict();
</code></pre>
<p>and use <code>$jq</code> as an alias for jQuery. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$jq(function () {
    $jq(&quot;a&quot;).click(function (event) { 
        event.preventDefault();
        alert(&quot;Hello world!&quot;); 
    });
});
</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to assign jQuery to <code>$</code> within a certain scope:</p>
<pre><code>jQuery(function ($) {
    // In here, the dollar sign is an alias for jQuery only.
});

// Out here, other libraries can use the dollar sign as an alias.
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can use <code>$</code> as an alias for jQuery inside that function block, without worrying about conflicts with other libraries.</p>
<h3>Cache your jQuery objects and chain whenever possible</h3>
<p>Calling the jQuery function <code>$()</code> is expensive. Calling it <em>repeatedly</em> is <strong>extremely inefficient</strong>. Avoid doing this:</p>
<pre><code>$('.test').addClass('hello');
$('.test').css('color', 'orange');
$('.test').prop('title', 'Hello world');
</code></pre>
<p>Instead cache your jQuery object in a variable:</p>
<pre><code>var $test = $('.test');

$test.addClass('hello');
$test.css('color', 'orange');
$test.prop('title', 'Hello world');
</code></pre>
<p>Or better yet, use chaining to reduce repetition:</p>
<pre><code>$('.test').addClass('hello').css('color', 'orange').prop('title', 'Hello world');
</code></pre>
<p>Also, remember that many functions can perform multiple changes in one call, by grouping all the values into an object. Instead of:</p>
<pre><code>$('.test').css('color', 'orange').css('background-color', 'blue');
</code></pre>
<p>use:</p>
<pre><code>$('.test').css({ 'color': 'orange', 'background-color': 'blue' });
</code></pre>
<h3>Variable naming conventions</h3>
<p>jQuery wrapped variables are usually named starting with <code>$</code> to distinguish them from standard JavaScript objects.</p>
<pre><code>var $this = $(this);
</code></pre>
<h3>Know your DOM properties and functions</h3>
<p>While one of the goals of jQuery is to abstract away the DOM, knowing DOM properties can be extremely useful. One of the most commonly made mistakes by those who learn jQuery without learning about the DOM is to utilize jQuery to access properties of an element:</p>
<pre><code>$('img').click(function () {
    $(this).attr('src');  // Bad!
});
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, <code>this</code> refers to the element from which the click event handler was fired. The code above is both slow and verbose; the code below functions identically and is much shorter, faster and more readable.</p>
<pre><code>$('img').click(function () {
    this.src; // Much, much better
});
</code></pre>
<h3>Idiomatic syntax for creating elements</h3>
<p>Although the following two examples seem to be functionally equivalent and syntactically correct, the first example is preferred:</p>
<pre><code>$('&lt;p&gt;', {
    text: 'This is a ' + variable, 
    &quot;class&quot;: 'blue slider', 
    title: variable, 
    id: variable + i
}).appendTo(obj);
</code></pre>
<p>By comparison, a string concatenation approach is much less readable and far more brittle:</p>
<pre><code>$('&lt;p class=&quot;blue slider&quot; id=&quot;' + variable + i + '&quot; title=&quot;' + variable + '&quot;&gt;This is a ' + variable + '&lt;/p&gt;').appendTo(obj);
</code></pre>
<p>While the first example will be slower than the second, the benefits of greater clarity will likely outweigh the nominal speed differences in all but the most performance-sensitive applications.</p>
<p>Moreover, the idiomatic syntax is robust against the injection of special characters. For instance, in the 2nd example, a quote character in <code>variable</code> would prematurely close the attributes. Doing the <a href=""http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/avoid-conflicts-other-libraries/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">proper encoding by yourself</a> remains possible even if not recommended because it is prone to error.</p>

"5","3607484","","","<p>Android is a mobile operating system developed by a consortium of developers known as the <em>Open Handset Alliance</em>, with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google. It is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software and is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. In addition, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Wear OS for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on game consoles, digital cameras, PCs, and other electronics.</p>

<p><strong>REST</strong> (<em>REpresentational State Transfer</em>) is an architectural style that uses identification of resources; manipulation of resources through representations; self-descriptive messages, and hypermedia as the engine of application state, to build distributed systems that are scalable and resilient to change.</p>
<p>The term was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation. Fielding is one of the principal authors of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a> (<code>HTTP</code>) specification versions 1.0 and 1.1.</p>
<p>In simple language, <code>REST</code> is an alternative to <code>SOAP</code> based web services. Where <code>SOAP</code> tries to model the exchange between client and server as calls to objects, <code>REST</code> tries to be faithful to the web domain.</p>

<p>The current DOM standard is at <a href=""https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/</a>. It is a complete specification for the DOM and supersedes all previous DOM specifications. </p>

<p>The legacy DOM2 specification <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/introduction.html</a> described the DOM in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is an <strong>application programming interface</strong> (API) for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents. It defines the <strong>logical structure</strong> of documents and <strong>the way a document is accessed and manipulated</strong>. [...] Nevertheless, <strong>XML presents this data as documents</strong>, and the DOM may be used to manage this data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the DOM is not a string, but HTML/XML may represent the DOM as a string.</p>

<p>In the distant past, the DOM was limited in the kinds of elements that could be accessed. Form, link and image elements could be referenced with a hierarchical name that began with the root document object. A hierarchical name could make use of either the names or the sequential index of the traversed elements. For example, a form input element could be accessed as either <code>document.formName.inputName</code> or <code>document.forms[0].elements[0]</code>.</p>

<h1>JavaScript vs. the DOM</h1>

<p>JavaScript is a language that the browser reads and does stuff with. But the DOM is where that stuff happens. </p>

<h1>When is the DOM different than the HTML?</h1>

<p>Here's one possibility: there are mistakes in your HTML and the browser has fixed them for you. Let's say you have a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element in your HTML and leave out the required <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> element. The browser will just insert that <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> for you. It will be there in the DOM, so you'll be able to find it with JavaScript and style it with CSS, even though it's not in your HTML.</p>

"5","3615096","","","<p>Asynchronous programming is a strategy for deferring operations with high latency or low priority, usually in an attempt to improve performance, responsiveness, and / or composability of software. Such strategies are usually employed using some combination of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Event driven programming"">event-driven programming</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Callbacks"">callbacks</a>, and optionally making use of concurrency through <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Coroutines"">coroutines</a> and / or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Threads"">threads</a>.</p>

<p>Asynchronous programming is used in many situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>handling user input in UIs and games,</li>
<li>processing network traffic,</li>
<li>performing disk I/O,</li>
<li>batching work,</li>
<li>and more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Asynchronous programming models can aid in software composition in many languages (notably languages where functions are first-class types) and APIs providing callback-based completion messaging. Proper use of this programming methodology can improve throughput and improve responsiveness by reducing total latency of job batches when executed in parallel. This approach can also result in an increase in system throughput at the cost of increased operational latency resulting from deferred processing.</p>

"5","3620111","","","<p>An algorithm is a set of <code>ordered</code> instructions based on a formal language with the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Finite</strong>. The number of instructions must be finite.</li>
<li><strong>Executable</strong>. All instructions must be executable in some language-dependent way, in a finite amount of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>An algorithm does not have to be deterministic - there are many random-based
algorithms, e.g. QuickSort with selecting the pivot element randomly. </p>

<p>An algorithm can be expressed in many ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>As a sequence of instructions</em></li>
<li><em>As a block-scheme</em></li>
<li><em>As a code in an existing or new programming language</em></li>
<li><em>As a piece of text in a human language</em></li>
<li><em>As a realization in a formal model of computation such as a Turing machine</em></li>
<li><em>Or in other, similar ways</em></li>
</ul>

<p>An algorithm can solve a class of problems. For example, both <em>""sum 1 and 3""</em> and <em>""sum 4 and 5""</em> are problems in the same class: <em>""sum two integer numbers.""</em> Furthermore, a given class of problems can generally be solved by a variety of algorithms.</p>

<p>One important aspect of algorithm design is performance. For large datasets, a good algorithm may outperform a poor algorithm by several orders of magnitude. Algorithm performance is often rated with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Big O or Î notation</a>, but one should be cautious with asymptotic notation, since big constants may be involved.</p>

<p>A key algorithm classification is known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Algorithm Complexity</a>.</p>

<p>Another important step of algorithm design is <em>proof of correctness</em>. The algorithm should actually provide a correct result for any instance of the problem. We should always take care of all the conditions where the proposed algorithm might <em>fail</em>. This could be done using several techniques, For example, Model Checking, Assertion, Loop Invariant.</p>

<p><a href=""//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>CSS</strong></a>, or <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>, is a language used to control the visual presentation of documents written in a markup language, including HTML, XML, XHTML, SVG, and XUL.</p>
<p>The visual presentation of HTML was originally defined by HTML attributes, but HTML 4 deprecated these attributes as CSS was introduced to separate the control of the visual presentation from content. In October 1994, <a href=""//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HÃ¥kon Wium Lie</a> first proposed <a href=""//www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cascading HTML Style Sheets</a> while working at CERN with Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who had been developing a web browser and inventing HTML.</p>
<p>A basic CSS document is made of rule sets. Each rule set starts with a <a href=""//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>selector</strong></a>, a pattern that matches elements in a <strong>HTML</strong> or <strong>XML</strong> document, and is followed by a block of zero or more property declarations that define the presentation of the matching elements. The selector is quasi-identical to the selector used by Javascript's <code>.querySelectorAll</code>. For example:</p>
<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>/* This is a comment */ 

a {                             /* Select all &lt;a&gt; elements (HTML links), */
    color: orange;              /* change their text color to orange, */
    background-color: pink;     /* their background color to pink, */
    text-decoration: none;      /* and remove text decorations like underlines. */
}

a:hover {                       /* Select all &lt;a&gt; elements which are currently being hovered over with the :hover pseudo-class*/
    color: red;                 /* change the color to red */
    text-decoration: underline; /* and add an underline again */
}
</code></pre>
<p>The simple example above also illustrates the <em>cascading</em> element of CSS. When you hover over a link (i.e., an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element) in <a href=""//www.htmldog.com/guides/cssbeginner/applyingcss/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an HTML page with this style sheet applied to it</a>, <em>both</em> rules apply. Because of the first rule, the link will have a pink background. But, since the <code>a:hover</code> selector is more specific, its <code>color</code> and <code>text-decoration</code> properties override those from the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> rule-set.</p>
<p>The <a href=""//www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#cascade"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cascading order</a> defines how <a href=""//www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css_specificity_wars.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">specificity</a> and other factors determine which property value is applied to an element.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Selector precedence and specificity</h3>
<p>Each component of a CSS selector can be based on one or more of four possible attributes of an HTML element:</p>
<ol>
<li>The element's ID (from the <code>id</code> attribute)</li>
<li>The name of one of the element's classes (in the <code>class</code> attribute)</li>
<li>The element's tag name</li>
<li>The element's properties or their values</li>
</ol>
<p>Selectors using an ID selector have higher priority than selectors using class names, and selectors using a class name have higher priority than selectors using tag names. This is called the selector precedence. The <code>!important</code> annotation can be used to override selector precedence, by elevating a <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-4/#declared"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">normal declaration</a> to an <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-4/#importance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">important declaration</a>. Whenever possible, however, higher specificity within a normal declaration should be used in preference to the creation of an important declaration via the <code>!important</code> annotation, in order to prevent overrides on any other styles that might need to be added, particularly those that are subsequently added with a natural precedence intent.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""false"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>/* any anchor element */
a {                
    color: orange;
}

/* any element with class name class1 */
.class1 {          
    color: red;
}    

/* the element with id anchor1 */
#anchor1 {
    color: green;
}</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;!-- Creates an anchor with a class of class1 and an ID of anchor1 --&gt;
&lt;a class=""class1"" id=""anchor1""&gt;Sample&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>In the above example, the text color of the content of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, the string &quot;Sample&quot;, will be green.</p>
<p>Repeated occurrences of the same selector also increase specificity, as noted in the <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#specificity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Selectors Level 3 W3C Recommendation</a>.</p>
<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>.class1.class1 {    /* repeated class selector */
    font-weight: bold;
}

.class1 {
    font-weight: normal;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the repeated selector has higher specificity than the singular selector, and the <code>font-weight</code> of our sample string will be bold.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Cascade_and_inheritance#Specificity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MDN</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specificity is basically a measure of how specific a selector is â how many elements it could match. [...] element selectors have low specificity. Class selectors have a higher specificity, so [classes] will win against element selectors. ID selectors have an even higher specificity, so [IDs] will win against class selectors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Complex selectors can be created by joining multiple simple ones together. It is also possible to style elements depending on an attribute:</p>
<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>/* The first &lt;a&gt; element inside a &lt;p&gt; element that's next to an &lt;h3&gt; element
   that's a direct child of #sidebar matches this rule */
#sidebar &gt; h3 + p a:first-of-type {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #333;
    font-style: italic;
}

/* Only &lt;img&gt; elements with the 'alt' attribute match this rule */
img[alt] {
    background-color: #F00;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A CSS rule specificity calculator is available <a href=""//specificity.keegan.st/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. It may help when a project has one or multiple large CSS files.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p>Inheritance is a key feature in CSS.</p>
<p>Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element but also to its descendants. In general, descendant elements automatically inherit text-related properties, but box-related properties are not automatically inherited.</p>
<ul>
<li>Properties that are inherited by default are <code>color</code>, <code>font</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code>, <code>line-height</code>, <code>list-style</code>, <code>text-align</code>, <code>text-indent</code>, <code>text-transform</code>, <code>visibility</code>, <code>white-space</code> and <code>word-spacing</code>.</li>
<li>Properties that are usually not inherited are <code>background</code>, <code>border</code>, <code>display</code>, <code>float</code> and <code>clear</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>width</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>min</code>/<code>max-height</code>/<code>width</code>, <code>outline</code>, <code>overflow</code>, <code>padding</code>, <code>position</code>, <code>text-decoration</code>, <code>vertical-align</code> and <code>z-index</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth noting that <a href=""//www.w3.org/wiki/Inheritance_and_cascade#Forcing_inheritance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">any property can be inherited</a> by using the <a href=""//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inherit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>inherit</code></a> property value. This should be used with care, however, since Internet Explorer (up to and including version 7) doesnât support this keyword. As an example:</p>
<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>/* Set the color of &lt;p&gt; elements to a light blue */
p {
    color: #C0FFEE;
}

/* Set the color of #sidebar to a light red */
#sidebar {
    color: #C55;
}

/* &lt;p&gt; elements inside #sidebar inherit their parent's color (#C55) */
#sidebar p {
    color: inherit;
}


/* You may also override inherited styles using the !important annotation */
#sidebar p:first-of-type {
    color: orange !important;
}
</code></pre>

It also describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.","23263","0","","","","2010-09-05 01:40:50"

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HTML</a> (HyperText Markup Language) is the markup language used for structuring web pages and other information to be displayed in a web browser. HTML describes the structure of a web-page semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language rather than a programming language. A browser 'renders' HTML in conjunction with CSS, which defines the 'style' (colors, fonts, layout, etc.) and JavaScript, which defines interactive and dynamic elements, adding style and behavior to the pages.</p>
<p><a href=""https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/</a> is the canonical HTML specification.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HTML</a> (HyperText Markup Language) is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information to be displayed to humans in a web-browser.</p>
<p>It was invented by Sir <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tim Berners-Lee</a> while developing the first Web browser at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CERN</a> to enable researchers to share their findings and formally released in June 1993. The original <a href=""http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991SepOct/0003.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">&quot;HTML Tags&quot;</a> were first publicly mentioned by Berners-Lee in 1991 and borrowed the syntax from CERN's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGMLguid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SGML-based documentation standard</a>. The latest and current version for HTML is <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/html/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HTML5.3</a>.</p>
<p>HTML elements form the building blocks of all web-pages. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded in a page. It references styles and scripts and carries meta-data. It can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. It can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior of HTML web pages. Web pages written in different programming languages (PHP, JSP, VF, ASP.NET etc.) get rendered as HTML in a browser.</p>
<p>HTML is a hierarchical (tree-structured) markup language. That is, an item might be a descendant of another item, which is its ancestor. However, if item2 is a descendant of item1, then they have an additional special relation: item2 is <em>inside</em> of item1, or item1 is <em>wrapped around</em> item2.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>HTML is written in the form of elements consisting of tags (and their attributes) enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>HTML tags most commonly come in pairs. The first is known as the <em>opening tag</em> and the second, which includes a forward slash, as the <em>closing tag</em> (e.g., <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>). Various types of content, such as text or additional HTML elements, can be contained within these tags. Some tags, however, are unpaired, and these are known as <em>empty elements</em> or <em>self-closing</em> tags. They may or may not include the slash (e.g., <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these tags form an HTML document. Web browsers read these documents, interpret each of the HTML tags, and then render their corresponding visual and/or audible display in the form of a webpage.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Standards</h3>
<p>HTML standards, as well as those for many other web technologies, are maintained by the <a href=""https://www.w3.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C).</p>
<p>HTML4 was introduced in 1997, and the latest iteration, HTML5, was recently developed by the W3C. What W3C calls <em>HTML5</em> is a subset, with a few modifications, of the HTML-Living-Standard which is specified by the <a href=""https://whatwg.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</a> (WHATWG).</p>
<p>The language specification and standards <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documents for HTML5 are available online</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Design and Scripting</h3>
<p>HTML markups are designed, or 'styled', via CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), using one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag, loading a CSS file</li>
<li>the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, where CSS rules are defined</li>
<li>the <code>style</code> attribute of HTML tags, where inline styles can be specified</li>
</ul>
<p>Dynamic and interactive parts of a page are programmed most frequently via JavaScript, using one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag with a <code>src</code> attribute pointing to the path of a script file</li>
<li>the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag with its inner text being the script</li>
<li>event attributes of tags, like <code>onclick</code></li>
</ul>

There are five ingredients to this recipe:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide a clear textual explanation of the problem at hand.</li>
<li>Provide proper sample data, as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DDL</a> (create table statement(s)) and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DML</a> (insert statement(s)). The sample data should be enough to demonstrate the problem, including edge cases. Usually, a few relevant rows are enough.</li>
<li>Provide the expected output for the sample data you've posted.</li>
<li>Show your attempts to solve the problem.</li>
<li>Tag properly. In addition to <a href=""/questions/tagged/sql"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sql&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sql</a>, also provide the relevant rdbms tag (i.e. <a href=""/questions/tagged/sql-server"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sql-server&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sql-server</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/oracle"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;oracle&#39;"" rel=""tag"">oracle</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/postgresql"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;postgresql&#39;"" rel=""tag"">postgresql</a>), and the lowest version you need the solution for (i.e <a href=""/questions/tagged/sql-server-2012"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sql-server-2012&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sql-server-2012</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/oracle10g"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;oracle10g&#39;"" rel=""tag"">oracle10g</a>).<br />

<p><strong>General Information</strong><br />
From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SQL stands for <em>Structured Query Language</em> (informally) and usually pronounced as <em>Sequel</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SQL is based on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">relational algebra</a>. In relational algebra, the word relation is synonymous with the word table. SQL is a standard to use relational algebra in a technical environment.</p>
<p>One subset of the SQL standard is <strong>DDL</strong> (Data Definition Language), which is used to create tables and constraints. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CREATE</code></li>
<li><code>DROP</code></li>
<li><code>ALTER</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Another subset is <strong>DML</strong> (Data Manipulation Language), which is used to modify and view data within the database:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SELECT</code></li>
<li><code>INSERT</code></li>
<li><code>UPDATE</code></li>
<li><code>DELETE</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The final &quot;standard&quot; subset of commands is <strong>DCL</strong> (Data Control Language):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GRANT</code></li>
<li><code>REVOKE</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Many database implementations require the use of SQL, and over the years, vendors have implemented dialects of SQL to provide more functionality as well as simplify it. Because of these deviations from the standard, SQL is fractured â syntax that works on one implementation does not necessarily work on another.</p>
<p><strong>ISO/IEC</strong> (formerly ANSI) standards have been beneficial in resolving such situations, but adoption is selective. Queries conforming to these standards should be portable to other databases, though performance may vary.</p>
<p>Most DBMSs have additional languages for writing stored procedures. In Oracle this is PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language), in PostgreSQL it's PL/pgSQL (Procedural Language/PostgreSQL). Outside of stored procedures or functions, Oracle and PostgreSQL use SQL. Thus the tags <a href=""/questions/tagged/plsql"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;plsql&#39;"" rel=""tag"">plsql</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/plpgsql"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;plpgsql&#39;"" rel=""tag"">plpgsql</a> should only be used for problems directly related to writing stored procedures. Microsoft SQL Server uses the term T-SQL (Transact-SQL)(<a href=""/questions/tagged/tsql"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;tsql&#39;"" rel=""tag"">tsql</a>) for both &quot;plain&quot; SQL (queries, DML, ..) and the language used for stored procedures.</p>

<h1 id=""tagging-recommendation-y3on"">Tagging Recommendation</h1>
<p>This tag should be used for general SQL programming language questions, in addition to tags for specific products. For example, questions about Microsoft SQL Server should use the <a href=""/questions/tagged/sql-server"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sql-server&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sql-server</a> tag, while questions regarding MySQL should use the <a href=""/questions/tagged/mysql"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;mysql&#39;"" rel=""tag"">mysql</a> tag. SQL is the umbrella under which these products exist; tagging them by product (including version, e.g <a href=""/questions/tagged/oracle11g"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;oracle11g&#39;"" rel=""tag"">oracle11g</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/sql-server-2008"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sql-server-2008&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sql-server-2008</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/hana"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hana&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hana</a>) is the easiest way to know what functionality is available for the task at hand. It is very common for <a href=""/questions/tagged/mysql"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;mysql&#39;"" rel=""tag"">mysql</a> questions to omit this tag because query discussions on MySQL are more often stated as MySQL rather than SQL in general.</p>
<p>Please read this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">summary</a> about the SQL standard (the 1992 one in this case, broadly implemented) and if you can, refer to the <a href=""http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/%7Eshadow/sql/sql1992.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">book itself</a>.</p>

"5","3607120","","","<p><a href=""https://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>ColdFusion</strong></a> is a server-side rapid application development platform from <a href=""https://www.adobe.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Adobe</a>, implementing the dynamic general purpose CFML programming language.</p>

<p>The term ColdFusion is sometimes colloquially used to refer to the CFML language (ColdFusion Markup Language), however there are multiple independent <a href=""/questions/tagged/cfml"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cfml&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cfml</a> implementations.</p>

<p>ColdFusion runs on the JVM using a servlet engine. Starting with ColdFusion 10, it uses a customised version of Tomcat. Earlier versions, ColdFusion 6 through 9, are bundled with JRun. (WAR installs and other servlet engines are supported.)</p>

<h2>Tag usage</h2>

<p>The <a href=""/questions/tagged/cfml"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cfml&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cfml</a> tag <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/168399/how-can-tag-synonyms-be-remapped-or-unmapped"">has been de-synonymised</a> from the <a href=""/questions/tagged/coldfusion"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;coldfusion&#39;"" rel=""tag"">coldfusion</a> tag to be its own distinct tag. If you are asking about general CFML concepts, be sure to use <a href=""/questions/tagged/cfml"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cfml&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cfml</a>. If you are asking about a non-Adobe ColdFusion implementation, be sure to use <a href=""/questions/tagged/lucee"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;lucee&#39;"" rel=""tag"">lucee</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/openbd"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;openbd&#39;"" rel=""tag"">openbd</a> or <a href=""/questions/tagged/railo"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;railo&#39;"" rel=""tag"">railo</a> tags as appropriate.</p>

<p>For all questions, remember to indicate which CFML engine version(s) you are running, the servlet engine (where relevant), and any CFML frameworks you might be using.</p>

<h2>Versions</h2>

<p>The initial release was as early as 1995 by Allaire. It was acquired by Adobe in 2005.</p>

<p>The most recent release, ColdFusion 2018, was released in July 2018.</p>

<h2>CFML Fiddles</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>You can run arbitrary CFML code against both Adobe ColdFusion and Railo servers in parallel on <a href=""http://cflive.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cflive.net</a>, though at this time there is no way to store and share code there in a traditional fiddle sense.</p></li>

<p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<p>Versions 1.0/1.2 and 2.0 of C# were submitted and approved as both <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20190114153439/http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-334.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ECMA</a> (<a href=""https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Web-Version</a>) and <a href=""http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c042926_ISO_IEC_23270_2006(E).zip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISO/IEC</a> standards. Latest ECMA version <a href=""https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">matches</a> Microsoft C# 5.0 specification. Language specifications are also available from Microsoft for C# <a href=""http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/8/8/388e7205-bc10-4226-b2a8-75351c669b09/CSharp%20Language%20Specification.doc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3.0</a> and C# <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7029"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">5.0</a> as well as C# <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">6.0</a> draft.</p>
<p>The language's type system was originally static, with only explicit variable declarations allowed. The introduction of <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/var"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>var</code></a> (C# 3.0) and <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/dynamic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>dynamic</code></a> (C# 4.0) allowed it to use type inference for implicit variable typing, and to consume dynamic type systems, respectively. Delegates, especially with lexical closure support for anonymous methods (C# 2.0) and lambda expressions (C# 3.0), allow the language to be used for functional programming.</p>
<p><strong>C# 5.0</strong> introduced the <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/async"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>async</code></a> and <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/await"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>await</code></a> keywords to simplify the use of asynchronous function calls.</p>
<p><strong>C# 6.0</strong> introduced the <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-conditional-operators"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">null propagation operator</a> <code>?.</code>, exception filters, <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/interpolated-strings"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">string interpolation</a>, and <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">many other features</a> that help to write simple code.</p>
<p><strong>C# 7.0</strong> introduced multiple <code>out</code> arguments, pattern matching, tuples for a return value, <code>is</code>-expressions &amp; <code>switch</code> statements with patterns, deconstruction, local functions, and some more.</p>
<p><strong>C# 7.1</strong> introduced generic Pattern Matching, inferred tuple element names, <code>default</code> literal expressions, async main, and some more.</p>
<p><strong>C# 7.2</strong> introduced <code>private protected</code>, non-trailing named arguments, digital separator after base specifier, ref conditional expression, reference semantics for value types, and some more.</p>
<p><strong>C# 7.3</strong> introduced features that enable safe code to be as performant as unsafe code, new compiler options, the usage of <code>out</code> variable declarations in field, property and constructor initializers, support <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> on tuple types and some more.</p>
<p><strong>C# 8.0</strong> introduced <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8#nullable-reference-types"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>nullable reference types</em></a> which generates compiler warnings about possible dereferencing of nulls unless the code expresses explicitly that a variable may be <code>null</code> (e.g., <code>string? foo</code> is a variable which may be null), <em>async streams</em> which empowers -especially- IoT and cloud integrations and <em>default interface methods</em> to prevent breaking changes to interfaces, along with <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some other</a> improvements.</p>
<p><strong>C# 9.0</strong> introduced plenty of new concepts and features such as <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#record-types"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Records</a>, <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#init-only-setters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Init only setters</a>, <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#top-level-statements"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Top-level statements</a>, <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#pattern-matching-enhancements"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pattern matching enhancements</a> and more.</p>
<p>The compilation is usually done in the <em>Microsoft Intermediate Language</em> (MSIL), which is then JIT-compiled to native code (and cached) during execution in the Common Language Runtime (CLR). However, options like <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/tools/ngen-exe-native-image-generator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NGen</a> (for the <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">.NET Framework</a>) and <a href=""https://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/aot/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AOT</a> (for Mono) mean that C# code can be directly compiled into the native image. Additionally, some frameworks (for example, the .NET Micro Framework) act as CIL interpreters, with no JIT.</p>
<p>Generics in C# are provided in part by the runtime, unlike C++ templates (templates are resolved at compile time), or Java's generics (which use type-erasure).</p>
<p>With the combination of <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">.NET Core</a> for Windows, macOS and Linux, <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">.NET Framework</a> for Windows (desktop/server/mobile), Mono that powers Xamarin applications on Android, Mac, iOS, tvOS and watchOS, Silverlight/Moonlight (browser/mobile), Compact Framework (mobile), and Micro Framework (embedded devices), it's available for a wide range of platforms.</p>

<p>While not a technology in itself, <a href=""/questions/tagged/ajax"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ajax&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ajax</a> is a term coined in 2005 by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_James_Garrett"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jesse James Garrett</a>, that described an approach to using a number of existing technologies together, including: <a href=""/questions/tagged/html"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;html&#39;"" rel=""tag"">html</a> / <a href=""/questions/tagged/xhtml"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;xhtml&#39;"" rel=""tag"">xhtml</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/css"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;css&#39;"" rel=""tag"">css</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/javascript"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;"" rel=""tag"">javascript</a>, the <a href=""/questions/tagged/dom"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;dom&#39;"" rel=""tag"">dom</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/xml"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;xml&#39;"" rel=""tag"">xml</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/xslt"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;xslt&#39;"" rel=""tag"">xslt</a>, and most importantly the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a> object. <a href=""/questions/tagged/ajax"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ajax&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ajax</a> uses the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> (abbreviated <a href=""/questions/tagged/xhr"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;xhr&#39;"" rel=""tag"">xhr</a>) API to manage <a href=""/questions/tagged/http"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;http&#39;"" rel=""tag"">http</a> requests from inside the code.</p>
<p>What makes <a href=""/questions/tagged/ajax"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ajax&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ajax</a> so useful is the <em>asynchronous</em> nature of the data exchange. Prior to its advent, data was only sent during the client communication phase (when the web page is first requested). This meant that all data had to either be loaded when the page was requested or the user interaction would be a series of HTML requests to the server with page refreshes. Each HTML request would provide additional information as part of the URL or as data in a form field with state data often kept as hidden field data. This second alternative used a series of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GET</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">POST</a> operations (i.e., load page, change data, post data, load page, etc.) resulting in the displayed page being refreshed, providing a choppy user experience and possible security issues.</p>
<p>Neither loading an entire data set into the client nor reloading the base page with each <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> request was cheap in terms of resources. <a href=""/questions/tagged/ajax"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ajax&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ajax</a> changed the web model by using JavaScript to asynchronously load data into the client as the data was needed.</p>
<p>The <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is the main method of interacting with the server and the client; it is supported by all modern browsers. There are a number of frameworks and libraries with a higher level API that encapsulate the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object, providing an easier interface to hide the complexity of using the object directly.</p>
<p>The client opens a new <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and requests a web page, just like a normal client call would. This request, however, is typically aimed at a special page that loads only data to be processed by JavaScript. As such, the data that needs to be exchanged can be limited to just what is necessary for that particular function, saving time, memory and bandwidth. Because it is asynchronous, this interaction does not have to block any other actions being done on the web page, and it lets the client/browser act more like a local, desktop program with the website, exchanging data as needed without reloading any other resources.</p>
<p>Although the &quot;X&quot; in <a href=""/questions/tagged/ajax"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ajax&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ajax</a> stands for <a href=""/questions/tagged/xml"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;xml&#39;"" rel=""tag"">xml</a>, any type of data can be sent and received. <a href=""/questions/tagged/json"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;json&#39;"" rel=""tag"">json</a> (<a href=""http://json.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JavaScript Object Notation</a>) has replaced <a href=""/questions/tagged/xml"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;xml&#39;"" rel=""tag"">xml</a> as the data interchange format of choice. A major reason for using JSON is that JavaScript natively parses JSON text, while XML must be parsed by a much slower and cumbersome set of <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Parsing_and_serializing_XML"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">client libraries</a>. Today, with the help of new <code>responseType</code> objects (<code>ArrayBuffer</code>, <code>Blob</code>, etc.), you can even request binary files via <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, and build much stronger and fully-featured web apps.</p>
<p>When <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> is used directly, the code must handle the communications layer and wait for the request-response to be complete. This is shown in the code example below starting with the line <code>if (xmlhttp.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; xmlhttp.status == 200)</code>. Since this callback function will be called every time the client receives a packet from the server, this test is needed to make sure the request state is complete and a valid <code>200</code> response is received before processing the response.</p>

<h3>AJAX Example 1:</h3>
<pre><code>var xmlhttp;
if (window.XMLHttpRequest) { // code for IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari
    xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
} else { // code for IE6, IE5
    xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject(&quot;Microsoft.XMLHTTP&quot;);
}
xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xmlhttp.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; xmlhttp.status == 200) {
        //stuff to do with response text (xmlhttp.responseText)
    }
}
xmlhttp.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;url&quot;, true);
xmlhttp.send();
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3>AJAX Example 2:</h3>
<pre><code>function (url, params) {
    // IE 5.5+ and every other browser
    var xhr = new(window.XMLHttpRequest || ActiveXObject)('MSXML2.XMLHTTP.3.0');

    xhr.open(&quot;POST&quot;, url, true);

    xhr.setRequestHeader(&quot;Content-type&quot;, &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8&quot;);
    xhr.setRequestHeader(&quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;application/json&quot;);
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
        if (this.readyState === 4) {
            if (this.status &gt;= 200 &amp;&amp; this.status &lt; 400) {
                console.log(JSON.parse(this.responseText));
            }
        }
    }
    xhr.send(params);
    xhr = null;
},
</code></pre>
<p>Because needing to test the status adds some complexity to <a href=""/questions/tagged/ajax"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ajax&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ajax</a>, there are many <a href=""/questions/tagged/javascript"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;"" rel=""tag"">javascript</a> libraries that will handle this interaction for you. Below is an example of using a common library, <a href=""/questions/tagged/jquery"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;jquery&#39;"" rel=""tag"">jquery</a> and shows how it simplifies <a href=""/questions/tagged/ajax"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ajax&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ajax</a></p>

<h3>jQuery AJAX Example:</h3>

<p>As of Chrome 42, Edge 14 and Firefox 39/52 there is a new API called <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>fetch</code></a> that drastically simplifies <a href=""/questions/tagged/ajax"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ajax&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ajax</a> in browsers. There is no support for Internet Explorer. <code>fetch</code> is Promised based.</p>
<h3>Fetch AJAX example:</h3>
<pre><code>fetch('/url')
    .then(res =&gt; res.json())
    .then(jsonData =&gt; console.log(jsonData));

fetch('/url', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({id: 1}), })
    .then(res =&gt; res.json())
    .then(jsonData =&gt; console.log(jsonData));
</code></pre>
<h3>Axios AJAX example:</h3>
<p>Axios is a Promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node JS.</p>
<pre><code>// Make a request for a user with a given ID
axios.get('/user?ID=12345')
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
</code></pre>

<pre><code>axios.post('/user', {
    firstName: 'Fred',
    lastName: 'Flintstone'
  })
  .then(function (response) {

<p>The <code>Architecture</code> tag on StackOverflow tends to cover a broad range of topics related to architecture, but mostly focuses on issues related to <strong>software</strong>.</p>

<p>More broadly...</p>

<p><strong>As a Process</strong></p>

<p>Architecture looks to gather information and make informed decisions regarding the nature of the solution.  This specifically includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interaction with various stakeholders.</li>
<li>Establishing the relative importance of various <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">System Quality Attributes</a> which will drive the architecture.</li>
<li>Evaluating different options against requirements (which can be both project specific and enterprise wide).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>As a Role</strong></p>

<p>Architecture covers the entire domain of software / information systems, and is composed of many specific roles that deal with the diverse complexity of that domain.</p>

<ul>
<li>Enterprise Architects who deal with the top most strategic level of (often business orientated) architecture.</li>
<li>Solution Architects who tend to work on project specific work, and whom cover a very broad range of technology.</li>
<li>Software Architects who tend to work very much as Solution Architects but with a specific focus on Software.</li>
</ul>

<p>These roles tend cover a broad spectrum of disciplines, and are supported by the follow roles which tend to have a much more specific focus and whom can cover both project specific work and enterprise wide concerns (such as tool selection): </p>

<ul>
<li>Infrastructure and Network Architects who deal with those respective areas (see <a href=""https://serverfault.com"">https://serverfault.com</a>).</li>
<li>Data Architects who deal with all aspects relating to data including management, quality and re-use.  Data Architects also deal with Business Intelligence.</li>

It is a comprehensive and very detailed book that tried to explain and make use of all the features available in C++, in the context of numerical methods. It introduced at the time several new techniques, such as the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP, also called Barton-Nackman trick).
It pioneered several techniques such as dimensional analysis and automatic differentiation.
It came with a lot of compilable and useful code, ranging from an expression parser to a Lapack wrapper.
The code is still available at <a href=""http://www.informit.com/store/scientific-and-engineering-c-plus-plus-an-introduction-9780201533934"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.informit.com/store/scientific-and-engineering-c-plus-plus-an-introduction-9780201533934</a>.
Unfortunately, the books have become somewhat outdated in the style and C++ features, however, it was an incredible tour-de-force at the time (1994, pre-STL).
The chapters on dynamics inheritance are a bit complicated to understand and not very useful.
An updated version of this classic book that includes move semantics and the lessons learned from the STL would be very nice.</p>

With the introduction of Microsoft SQL Server 2005, the SQL Server code was completely re-written to provide integration with .Net.</p>

<p>Transact-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications that communicate with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application.</p>

<p>It adheres to nearly all SQL standards, yet supplies an additional set of functionality not a part of the SQL standard, with concepts such as common table expressions, index hints, and the ability to SELECT scalars.</p>

<p>Most programming languages provide a dedicated string data type or more general facilities and conventions for handling strings; as well as providing a way to denote string literals. In some programming languages <a href=""http://wiki.tcl.tk/3018"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">everything is a string</a>, for example in Tcl. A dedicated support library of differing sophistication is mostly provided as well.</p>
<p>String representations vary widely in the features they offer; the right string type can easily decrease the order of algorithms, while the wrong one might not even be able to accommodate your string data at all.</p>
<p>The following are some hand-picked representatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero-terminated Strings (aka. C-strings, ASCIZ, sz) are arrays of non-null elements, terminated by a special, null element (variants using a different terminating symbol are mostly restricted to old systems, e.g. DOS supported <code>$</code>).</li>
<li>Counted String (aka Pascal Strings) are arrays of arbitrary bytes, prefixed by a length indicator. Nowadays, the size for counted strings is restricted by available address space, though it was quite common to use a single byte for length (implying maximum length of 255).</li>
<li>Ropes, which are lists of segments (for example length + pointers into modifiable and non-modifiable buffers), for efficient insertion and deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many (especially functional) languages support strings as a list of base symbols.</p>
<p>For Unicode support, a special string of the strings type is getting common, as Unicode characters can be of arbitrary length, even in UTF-32. This enables efficient character-indexing by pushing the complexities of the character set into the string type.</p>
<p>In most languages, strings can be iterated over, similar to lists/arrays. In some high-level languages (in which strings are a data type unto themselves), strings are immutable, so string operations create new strings.</p>
<p>For text strings, many encodings are in used, though modern usage is converging on Unicode, using UTF-8 (some early adopters of Unicode instead transitioned form UCS2 to UTF-16 as a persistence format).</p>
<p>Windows software often adopts the WinAPI convention of using UTF-16 internally, converting for external data and persistence instead of system calls.</p>
<p>A <code>String Literal</code> is an occurrence of a string phrase in source code, generally encapsulated in dedicated delimiters (for example, in C/C++ and Java a String literal is surrounded by double quotes - &quot;This is a String Literal&quot;).</p>

It is often used instead of <a href=""/questions/tagged/xml"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;xml&#39;"" rel=""tag"">xml</a> because of its lightweight and compact structure.</p>
<p>Many programming languages provide methods for parsing a JSON-formatted text string into a native object and vice versa. For example, JavaScript in modern browsers and other environments includes the methods <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JSON.parse()</a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JSON.stringify()</a>.</p>
<p>The JSON format is based on two types of structures:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Collection of name/value pairs</p>
<pre><code>{&quot;name1&quot;:&quot;value1&quot;, &quot;name2&quot;:&quot;value2&quot;}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>An ordered list of values (more commonly referred to as an array)</p>
<pre><code>[&quot;value1&quot;, &quot;value2&quot;]
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>JSON defines six types of values: <em>null</em>, <em>numbers</em>, <em>strings</em>, <em>booleans</em>, <em>arrays</em> and <em>objects</em>. With regard to objects, the order of members is not significant, and the behavior of a JSON parser when duplicate member names are encountered is undefined.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>JSON is <em>not</em> the same thing as JavaScript object literals</strong>. Rather, JSON is a common format to serialize from and deserialize to objects in most languages.

<p><strong>Object-oriented programming (OOP)</strong> is a programming paradigm using the concept of <strong>objects</strong>. These encapsulates data which is organized in the form of fields (often known as <strong>attributes</strong>) and code, in the form of procedures (often known as <strong>methods</strong>). Methods can access and often modify attributes of the object with which they are associated. In OOP, computer programs are designed based on having objects interacting among each other.</p>
<p>OOP includes features such as data abstraction, encapsulation, messaging, modularity, polymorphism, and inheritance. Many modern programming languages now support OOP.</p>

"5","4914090","","","<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A subroutine, (also known as a procedure, function, routine, method, or subprogram) is a portion of code within a larger program that performs a specific task and is relatively independent of the remaining code.</p>
  
  <p>The content of a subroutine is its body, which is executed when the subroutine is called or invoked.</p>
  
  <p>A subroutine may be written so that it expects to obtain one or more data values -- known as parameters or arguments -- from the calling program. It may also return a computed value to its caller (its return value), or provide various result values or out(put) parameters. Indeed, a common use of subroutines is to implement mathematical functions, in which the purpose of the subroutine is purely to compute one or more results whose values are entirely determined by the parameters passed to the subroutine. (Examples might include computing the logarithm of a number or the determinant of a matrix.)</p>
  
  <p>However, a subroutine call may also have side effects, such as modifying data structures in the computer's memory, reading from or writing to a peripheral device, creating a file, halting the program or the machine, or even delaying the program's execution for a specified time. A subprogram with side effects may return different results each time it is called, even if it is called with the same arguments. An example is a random number function, available in many languages, that returns a different pseudorandom number each time it is called. The widespread use of subroutines with side effects is a characteristic of imperative programming languages.</p>
  
  <p>A subroutine can be coded so that it may call itself recursively, at one or more places, in order to perform its task. This technique allows direct implementation of functions defined by mathematical induction and recursive divide and conquer algorithms.</p>
  
  <p>A subroutine whose purpose is to compute a single boolean-valued function (that is, to answer a yes/no question) is called a predicate. In logic programming languages, often all subroutines are called ""predicates"", since they primarily determine success or failure. For example, any type of function is a subroutine but not <code>main()</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a common unit of code for most other programming languages.</p>

<p>Function also has a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28mathematics%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mathematical definition</a>, which is important in computer science and statistics. Mathematical function is a one-to-one relationship where for one argument it always return the same one value. In pure functional languages like Haskell there are only mathematical functions allowed.</p>

"5","4924550","","","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HyperText Transfer Protocol</a> (HTTP) uses a client-request/server-response model. The protocol is stateless, which means it does not require the server to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests. However, for performance reasons and to avoid the connection-latency issues of TCP, techniques like persistent, parallel or pipelined connections may be used.</p>
<p>The request is sent with an HTTP method:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>HEAD</code> - used to retrieve the <code>GET</code> response header without the actual content (i.e., just the metadata in the content).</li>
<li><code>GET</code> - used to retrieve data, where the request body is ignored.</li>
<li><code>POST</code> - used to send data, contained in the request body, to the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all the methods supported by older browsers, but the <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HTTP 1.1 specification</a> includes a few more: <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, <code>TRACE</code>, <code>OPTIONS</code>, <code>CONNECT</code> and <code>PATCH</code>.</p>
<p>The response is returned with a <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">status code</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>1xx</code> are informational</li>
<li><code>2xx</code> indicates success, most pages will have a <code>200</code> status</li>
<li><code>3xx</code> are used for redirections</li>
<li><code>4xx</code> codes are used for errors with the request, the commonest being <code>404</code> for &quot;Page not found&quot;</li>
<li><code>5xx</code> are used for server errors</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the request and response are made up of a header and an optional body.</p>
<p>The header contains a list of key-value pairs, separated using new lines and colons. For example, a request may have headers like this:</p>
<pre><code>Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Referer: URL
User-Agent: browser name or client application
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Accept-Language: en-GB
</code></pre>
<p>Note that in the example the request is telling the server that the response can be sent with the body compressed with either gzip or DEFLATE encoding.</p>
<p>The request needs a body if it is sending additional data to the server, for instance, if sending information entered into a form.</p>
<p>The response headers will include information telling the client how to deal with the response data, for instance, whether they can cache the data (and how long for).</p>
<p>The response body will have the requested data, such as the HTML of a web page or image data.</p>
<p>HTTP is used by browsers to retrieve web content, but can also be used for data APIs, for instance, as a <a href=""/questions/tagged/soap"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;soap&#39;"" rel=""tag"">soap</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/rest"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;rest&#39;"" rel=""tag"">rest</a>, or <a href=""/questions/tagged/graphql"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graphql&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graphql</a> service.</p>

<p>The tag <a href=""/questions/tagged/unix"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;unix&#39;"" rel=""tag"">unix</a> can be used for Unix system programming related problems. The tag can also contain programming questions about using the Unix platform. For non-programming Unix usage questions, visit the <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/"">Unix &amp; Linux</a> Stack Exchange site.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Unix</a> was developed as an in-house operating system for <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, but in the 1980s became both a prime academic operating system (with U.C. Berkeley's version, called <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/bsd/info"">BSD</a>, being the reference platform for development of what would become the Internet) and a commercial success in the form of AT&amp;T's System V, Microsoft/SCO's XENIX (PCs) and various workstation versions from Sun, Silicon Graphics, and others.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, Sun's Solaris and the free Unix clone <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/linux/info"">Linux</a> would rise in popularity. Linux is largely Unix-compatible but lacks the trademark. Currently, Unix is commonly found on server platforms; the primary desktop variant is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/osx/info"">Mac OS X</a>, based on BSD.</p>

<p>Apart from its command-line interface, most ""Unices"" support the standardized <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/xwindow/info"">X Window System</a> for GUIs. (So does Mac OS X, but its primary GUI is Apple's proprietary Quartz.)</p>

<p>The various Unix implementation (and to a lesser extent, clones such as Linux) are unified in a standard called <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/posix/info"">POSIX</a>. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/c/info"">C</a> has been its primary programming language since the 1970s, but many other languages are available.</p>

<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Almquist shell</a> and Debian Almquist shell (dash)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_shell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Korn shell</a> (ksh)

<ul>
<li>Public Domain Korn Shell (pdksh), not developed since 1999</li>
<li>MirBSD Korn Shell (mksh)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GNU <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bourne again shell</a> (bash)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Z Shell</a> (zsh)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rc</a> (rc)</li>
<li>C shell family

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">csh</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcsh"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tcsh</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>While some of these resemble each other closely, there are often subtle differences:</p>

<p>All of ksh93, mksh and bash are supersets of the POSIX shell, which in turn is a superset of the original Bourne Shell. By default, they support mutually incompatible extensions in syntax and behavior, but also share some extensions (beyond what POSIX offers).</p>

<p>The Z Shell and rc are, by default, <strong>not</strong> compatible with the POSIX shell family. Questions about the shell and code samples should be clear about the environment and the version of the shell.</p>

<p>Tcsh comes originally as a design improvement to the original C shell. The tcsh shell has been widely used before bash became the established shell. One major popular system implementation was the Solaris family. The shell concepts <code>~</code> (tilde for home directory), history, path expansion (globbing), directory stack and aliases all originally came from the csh.</p>

<p>Some view the DOS '<code>cmd</code>' prompt as a minimal shell of sorts.  It is also possible to install <a href=""https://www.cygwin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cygwin</a> or <a href=""http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSYS</a>/<a href=""https://msys2.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSYS2</a> on Windows and emulate a Unix environment with complete shell capabilities or use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> (""Bash on Ubuntu on Windows"").</p>

<p>In graphical user mode, terminal emulators are used to access the shell.  Examples are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">xterm</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GNOME Terminal</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_%28macOS%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OS X Terminal</a>.</p>

collection of elements (values or variables),
each identified by at least one index,
stored in contiguous memory locations. </p>

<p>An array is typically stored so that the position
of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.  </p>

<p>In some languages (C, Java, etc.) the length of the array must be set beforehand. In other languages (Ruby, Python, LISP, Haxe, etc.) the length of the
array grows dynamically as elements are added.</p>

<p>When tagging a question with this tag,
also tag the question with the programming language being used.</p>

<h2>Array in specific languages</h2>

<ul>
<li>C# arrays are actually objects and not just addressable regions of contiguous memory as in C and C++.
Array is the abstract base type of all array types.
You can use the properties and other class members of the Array base type.</li>
<li>C arrays act to store related data under a single
variable name with an index,
also known as a subscript.
They are stored in row-major order,
which means the last subscript varies fastest.
It is easiest to think of an array as simply a list or ordered grouping for
variables of the same type.
As such, arrays often help a programmer organize collections of
data efficiently and intuitively.</li>
<li>C++ inherits raw arrays from C and adds its own array-class <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>std::array</code></a>
for compile-time array sizes,
<a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>std::vector</code></a> for
runtime dynamic sized arrays.
It also has smart pointer implementations like
<a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>std::unique_ptr</code></a>,
<a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>std::shared_ptr</code></a>.</li>
<li>Objective C inherits raw arrays from C and adds its
own array-class <code>NSArray</code> and <code>NSMutableArray</code> for dynamic arrays.</li>
<li>Ruby's normal array class is called <code>array</code>.</li>
<li>In Python,
the normal array datatype is called a <code>list</code>,
while the <code>array</code> type is used for homogeneous arrays.</li>
<li>In NumPy there is a powerful N-dimensional array
<a href=""http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/array_object.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">with many capabilities</a>.</li>
<li>PHP arrays are implemented as ordered maps
which may contain a mix of numeric or string keys.</li>
<li>JavaScript arrays are just objects with a
different prototype
(<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Methods"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">with additional functions</a> more useful for array-like structures),
with numerical index values stored as strings (all JavaScript keys are strings).
Unlike other objects,
you cannot use dot notation to access keys - only square bracket notation.</li>
<li>In Haxe,
an Array has one type parameter which corresponds to the type
of collection of elements.
Arrays can be created using their constructor
<code>new Array()</code> or <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>,
but also using Array comprehension:
<code>[for (i in 0...10) if (i % 2 == 0) i]</code>.
For storage of fixed size the abstract type <code>haxe.ds.Vector</code> can be used,
which may be faster than Array on some targets and is never slower.</li>
<li>In Scala,
the normal array class is called <code>Array</code>.
To get an element from an array you use parentheses
(most languages use square brackets).</li>
<li>In Java,
an array is a container object that holds a fixed number
of values of a single type.
The length of an array is established when the array is created.
After creation,
its length is fixed.</li>
<li>In Perl,
array variables are denoted with the <code>@</code> prefix and arrays
are declared with parentheses.
Replacing the prefix with <code>$#</code> returns the last index.</li>
<li>In Rust,
arrays are groups of data of the same type that are contiguous in memory,
so they can be used when communicating with C.
The length of an array is fixed.</li>
<li>In Swift,
an array that includes the specified values,
automatically inferring the arrayâsÂ <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Element</a>Â type.
Swift makes it easy to create arrays in your code using an
array literal: simply surround a comma-separated list of values with square brackets.</li>
<li>In Pascal, arrays declarations specify the <em>index range</em> rather than the number of elements; so <code>parray: array [1..25] of real;</code> declares a <strong>one</strong>-based array of 25 real numbers (valid elements are <code>parray[1]</code> thru <code>parray[25]</code>), whereas <code>parray: array [0..24] of real;</code> declares a <strong>zero</strong>-based ('C-style') array of the same size (the first element is <code>parray[0]</code>). <em>Pascal array index ranges can include negative numbers!</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Characteristics</h2>

<p>Elements of an array are usually specified with a 0-first index,
for example,
<code>myarray[0]</code> would represent the first element of <code>myarray</code>.
<code>myarray[n]</code> (where <code>n</code> is the length of the array minus 1)
would represent the last element in the array.
However, some languages such as old Fortran and Lua use 1 as the initial index.</p>

<p>Some languages (C++, Java, C#) have ""basic arrays"" and collections.
Basic arrays are supported by the compiler directly,
have a fixed size,
and only provide element access by index.
Collections,
like Java's <code>ArrayList</code>,
are system library classes implemented on the top of these basic arrays
and have a wide range of various methods.
In such cases,
the tag <a href=""/questions/tagged/arrays"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;arrays&#39;"" rel=""tag"">arrays</a> should be used to name the simple arrays.</p>

<p>Arrays can be statically allocated or dynamically allocated.
The way in which you access the array and its type varies based on
how it is declared and allocated.</p>

<p>Arrays can contain multiple indices.
For example, an array with one index (e.g. <code>array[0]</code>)
is known as a one-dimensional array.
If it has two indices (e.g. <code>array[0][0]</code>) it is considered two dimensional
and maybe visualized as a grid.
Multidimensional arrays,
or,
in other words,
arrays with multiple indices are called matrices,
or a matrix is singular.</p>

"5","4973765","","","<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A database is an organized collection of data. It is the collection of tables, queries, reports, views and other objects. The data is typically organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A large proportion of websites and applications rely on databases. They are a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstraction, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The term <em>database</em> should not be confused with <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_management_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Database Management System</a></em> (DBMS). A DBMS is the system software used to create and manage databases and provide users and applications with access to the database(s). A database is to a DBMS as a document is to a word processor.</p>
<h3>Database Languages</h3>
<p>Database languages are special-purpose languages, which do one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Data definition language</a>: defines data types and the relationships among them</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Data manipulation language</a>: performs tasks such as inserting, updating, or deleting data occurrences. The most widely used DML is SQL.</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Query language</a>: allows searching for information and computing derived information</li>
</ul>
<p>###ACID
In computer science, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ACID</a> (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties of database transactions.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Atomicity - Atomicity requires that each transaction be &quot;all or nothing&quot;: if one part of the transaction fails, then the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors, and crashes. To the outside world, a committed transaction appears (by its effects on the database) to be indivisible (&quot;atomic&quot;), and an aborted transaction does not happen.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consistency - The consistency property ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another. Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This does not guarantee correctness of the transaction in all ways the application programmer might have wanted (that is the responsibility of application-level code) but merely that any programming errors cannot result in the violation of any defined rules.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Isolation - The isolation property ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially, i.e., one after the other. Providing isolation is the main goal of concurrency control. Depending on the concurrency control method (i.e., if it uses strict - as opposed to relaxed - serializability), the effects of an incomplete transaction might not even be visible to another transaction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Durability - The durability property ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors. In a relational database, for instance, once a group of SQL statements execute, the results need to be stored permanently (even if the database crashes immediately thereafter). To defend against power loss, transactions (or their effects) must be recorded in a non-volatile memory.</p>

<p>A date by itself (such as <code>Jan 1 2014</code>) does not refer to a specific moment in time.</p>

<ul>
<li>It does not have a time of day, so it refers to a whole calendar date.</li>
<li>It does not specify a time zone, so it could be interpreted differently by each viewer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Related concepts such as ""today"", ""yesterday"", and ""tomorrow"", or any individual day of the week such as ""Monday"" or ""Tuesday"", also have the same qualities.  They are loose terms that require a time zone in order to lock in to a specific range of time.</p>

<p>In some programming languages, such as <a href=""/questions/tagged/javascript"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;"" rel=""tag"">javascript</a>, the <code>Date</code> type actually represents a date and time of day and is therefore misnamed.</p>

<p>The most recognized calendar is the Gregorian calendar, but there are other known calendars such as the Hebrew or the Hijri (Muslim) calendar. Since both start at a different date from the Gregorian calendar's date, the dates in these calendars are different.

"5","5048292","","","<p>The performance of applications is often a paramount concern for mission-critical systems. If your question pertains to optimization, whether it be database queries, algorithms, reducing network/transactional overhead, resource contention, or anything that deals with speed or capacity, consider using this tag.</p>

<p>A good question states performance goals that need to be achieved as well as other restrictions. Trying to optimize something without measuring is not a ""performance"" question or work, but most likely personal entertainment - expect a question without goals/measurements to be treated as such.</p>

<p>Performance for many programs is represented in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">big O notation</a>, which classifies how an algorithm's resource requirements change in response to a change in the input size.</p>

<p>This tag can also represent <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_tuning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">system performance</a>, which is one of the key non-functional requirements of an application or system.</p>

<p>The two main measures of performance are</p>

<ul>
<li>Throughput (how many in a time frame). Example of units: transactions per second (TPS), megabytes per second (MB/s), gigabits per second (Gb/s), messages/request/pages per second.</li>
<li>Latency (how long for an action). For example, seek time of 8&nbsp;ms and search time of 100&nbsp;ms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Latency is often qualified with a statistical measure. Note: latencies usually don't follow a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">normal distribution</a> and have very high upper limits compared with the average latency. As such the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">standard deviation</a> is not useful.</p>

<ul>
<li>Average latency. The average of all the latencies.</li>
<li>Typical or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">median</a> latency. The mid-point of the range of possible latencies. This is usually 50% to 90% of the average latency. As this is the lowest figure it is often reported by vendors.</li>
<li>Percentile latency. The figure which it is less than or equal to N% of the time. That is, 99 percentile if the latency is not more than this, 99 times out of 100.</li>
<li>Worst or maximum latency. The highest latency measured.</li>
</ul>

<p>When seeking to improve performance: prototype and measure first, optimize only if and where needed.</p>

<p>There are a variety of interpreters that receive commands either interactively or as a sequence of commands from a file. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bourne-again shell</a> (Bash) is one such interpreter. Bash implements the standard <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bourne Shell</a> (sh), and offers numerous additions.</p>
<p>From the Free Software Foundation's <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bash page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bash is an <code>sh</code>-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the KornShell (ksh) and C shell (<code>csh</code>). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 <em>Shell and Tools</em> standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read the <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bash manual</a> for technical details.</p>
<p>Bash was written by Brian Fox and first released in 1989.  It is the default shell in many Linux distributions; it is available on most modern operating systems, and has been ported to Windows 10.</p>
<h2>A note regarding versions</h2>
<p>As of August 2021, the most recent version of <code>bash</code> is 5.1, although you may be using an older version depending on your operating system and
which updates to <code>bash</code> have been installed. Most Linux installations should be using something in the 4.x family. macOS (formerly Mac OS X) only provides version 3.2 due to licensing issues.</p>
<p>Be sure to note in your question what version of <code>bash</code> you are using. This will alert potential answerers to what features are available to you, as well as which bugs may need to be worked around.</p>
<p>You can determine which version of <code>bash</code> you are using by running <code>bash --version</code> or checking the value of the <code>BASH_VERSION</code> shell variable.</p>
<p>Without an explicit version, an answerer may well assume you are using at least version 4.2 (it's been available for over 10 years).

<p>Additionally, all versions for <code>bash</code> from 2.0 and later received an important patch-level release to address the Shellshock vulnerability in September 2014.</p>
<h1>Before asking about problematic code</h1>
<p>To help the kind people who assist you, to ensure that future readers can benefit from your question, and to help ensure your question is voted up as useful for that lovely karma, please make your question as simple and universal as possible:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Check whether your script or data has DOS style end-of-line characters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use <code>cat -v yourfile</code> or <code>echo &quot;$yourvariable&quot; | cat -v</code> .</p>
<p>DOS carriage returns will show up as <code>^M</code> after each line.</p>
<p>If you find them, delete them using <code>dos2unix</code> (a.k.a. <code>fromdos</code>) or <code>tr -d '\r'</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure you run the script with <code>bash</code>, not <code>sh</code></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first line in the script must be <code>#!/bin/bash</code> or <code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code>.</p>
<p>It <strong>must not</strong> be <code>#!/bin/sh</code> <em>even if your system's <code>/bin/sh</code> is a symlink to <code>/bin/bash</code></em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Run the script with <code>./yourscript</code> or <code>bash yourscript</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Do not</strong> run it with <code>sh yourscript</code>.</p>
<p>This applies even when <code>sh</code> is a symlink to <code>bash</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Find a <a href=""http://www.sscce.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">small, self-contained example</a>.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don't include sections and commands unrelated to your problem.</li>
<li>Avoid complex commands that just serve to produce a value (include the value directly).</li>
<li>Avoid relying on external files. Create the files on the fly, include the data directly, or post a small example of a file in your question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Test your example.</strong> Make sure it runs and still shows the problem. <em>Do not brush this off</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reformatting for clarity often sidesteps pitfalls related to spacing and naming.</li>
<li>Refactoring for simplicity often sidesteps pitfalls related to subshells.</li>
<li>Mocking out files and data often sidesteps problems related to special characters.</li>
<li>Hours spent trying multiple things often leads to posting code from one version and errors from another.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Check the example for common problems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Run your example through <code>shellcheck</code> or the <a href=""//www.shellcheck.net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">online shellcheck service</a> to automatically check for common mistakes.</li>
<li>Browse <a href=""http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bash pitfalls</a> and <a href=""http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/newbie_traps"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bash beginner's mistakes</a> as well as the <em>Popular Questions</em> section below for checklists of common issues.</li>
<li>Check your data for special characters, using <code>cat -v yourfile</code> or <code>cat -v &lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;$yourvar&quot;</code>. Be especially careful with carriage returns (shown as <code>^M</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Please avoid tagging questions that are solely about external commands.</strong> The <code>bash</code> tag should be reserved for Bash-related problems, not any CLI problem you might have.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>How to turn a bad script into a good question</h1>
<p>For example, let's say you have a script for alerting you when a server is idle, but it keeps alerting even when the machine is not idle:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code># Avoid code like this when asking about a problem
# It has irrelevant code and external dependencies, and is hard to read and run

while true
do
  load=$(wget -O - &quot;http://$1/load.php&quot; | grep &quot;^load:&quot; | cut -d: -f 2)
  if [[ $load==&quot;0&quot; ]]
  then 
    mailx -s &quot;System is idle&quot; user@example.com &lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;The server is idle&quot;
    break
  else
    echo &quot;Waiting...&quot;
    sleep 60
  fi
done
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>The problem still occurs without the loop: Remove the loop from your question.</li>
<li>The problem still occurs if you skip asking the server: Hard code the response (e.g. <code>load=42</code>)</li>
<li>The problem still occurs without emailing: Use <code>echo &quot;Why does this run?&quot;</code></li>
<li>The problem still occurs when removing the else branch. Shorten it</li>
</ol>
<p>We're now left with this <strong>small, self-contained example</strong>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code># Prefer code like this when asking about a problem
# It's small, simple and self contained, making it easy to read and run.

load=42
if [[ $load==&quot;0&quot; ]]
then
  echo &quot;Why does this run?&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Thanks for making your question simple and useful! Enjoy your upvotes!</strong></p>
<p>(However, note that this example is simple to compare against the relevant entry in <a href=""http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls#pf10"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bash pitfalls</a> and the error is automatically caught by <code>shellcheck</code>, so now you don't actually need to ask!)</p>

<p>The name comes from <a href=""/questions/tagged/ed"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ed&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ed</a> and similar editors, and is derived from <strong>g</strong>lobal / <strong>r</strong>egular <strong>e</strong>xpression / <strong>p</strong>rint.</p>
<p>Grep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines matching a regular expression. Grep was originally developed for the Unix operating system, but is available today for all Unix-like systems.</p>
<p>There are many programming languages which include a command or statement called <code>grep</code>; please simply use that language's tag for questions which do not pertain to the Unix utility.</p>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>The following are the several implementations of grep available in some Unix environments:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""/questions/tagged/egrep"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;egrep&#39;"" rel=""tag"">egrep</a>: same as <code>grep -E</code> - Interprets the pattern as an extended regular expression.</li>
<li><a href=""/questions/tagged/fgrep"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;fgrep&#39;"" rel=""tag"">fgrep</a>: same as <code>grep -F</code> - Interprets the pattern as a list of fixed strings, separated by newlines, any of which is to be matched.</li>
<li><a href=""/questions/tagged/pgrep"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;pgrep&#39;"" rel=""tag"">pgrep</a>: displays the processes whose names match a given regular expression.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common options</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>-f file</code>      - Obtain patterns from file, one per line.</li>
<li><code>-i</code>           - Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the input files.</li>
<li><code>-o</code>           - Show only the part of a matching line that matches the pattern.</li>
<li><code>-c</code>           - Print a count of matching lines for each input file.</li>
<li><code>-R</code>           - Read all files under each directory recursively.</li>
<li><code>-v</code>           - Invert the sense of matching to select non-matching lines.</li>

"5","5107863","","","<p>A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Loops"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">loop</a> is a fundamental programming idea that is commonly used in writing programs.</p>

<h2>Types</h2>

<p>A loop can be categorized in two different ways,</p>

<p><strong>1.
Entry Controlled Loops</strong></p>

<p>A loop which checks for the condition before the iteration is known as Entry Controlled loops - for example</p>

<ul>
<li>while loop - iterates while a certain condition is true</li>
<li>until loop - iterates while a certain condition is false</li>
<li>for loop - iterates through numbers in a certain range. Note: not the same as <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/for"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C++ <code>for</code> loop</a></li>
<li>foreach loop - iterates through the elements of a collections.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.
Exit Controlled Loops</strong></p>

<p>A loop which checks the condition after the iteration is knows as Exit Controlled loop  - for example</p>

<ul>
<li>do-while loop - iterates while a certain condition is true (the first iteration will run regardless of the condition)</li>
<li>do-until loop - iterates while a certain condition is false (the first iteration will run regardless of the condition)</li>
</ul>

<p>Most languages provide only a subset of loop types described above. For example: in Python there are only foreach (keyword <code>for</code>) and while loops.</p>

<h2>Break and continue</h2>

<p>In some languages, there are two keywords that simplify the task of implementing a more advanced control flow: <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>. The former allows you to jump to the operator immediately after the loop, the latter allows you to jump to the end of the current iteration.</p>

<p>Example: implementation of do-until loop in Python using the <code>break</code> keyword:</p>

<pre><code>while True:
    // loop body
    if condition:
        break
</code></pre>

"5","5110602","","","<p>The Big-O notation is used to represent asymptotic upper-bounds. It allows a person to see if a problem will take years or seconds to compute on a modern computer. </p>

<p>In computer science, it is most commonly used when talking about the time complexity of algorithms, but can also refer to the storage required.</p>

<p>For example, a linear search on an unsorted array of size N, is O(N). If we put the elements first in a hash table, the space used is O(N) (Theta(N) to be more precise), but the search time is O(1) in the average case.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Big-O only represents an <em>upper</em> bound for a function. Therefore an O(N) function will also be O(NlogN), O(NÂ²), O(N!), etc. In many cases Big-O is used imprecisely and Big-Theta should be used instead.</p>

<p>If a complexity is given by a recurrence relation, an analysis can often be carried out via the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Master Theorem</a>.</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Summation</em> <br>
O(f(n)) + O(g(n)) -> O(max(f(n), g(n))) <br>
For example: O(n^2) + O(n) = O(n^2)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplication by a positive constant</em> <br>
O(c * f(n)) -> O(f(n)) <br>
For example: O(1000 * n^2) = O(n^2)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplication</em> <br>
O(f(n)) * O(g(n)) -> O(f(n) * g(n)) <br>
For example: O(n^2) * O(n) = O(n^2 * n) = O(n^3)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Transitivity</em> <br>
f(n) = O(g(n)) and g(n) = O(h(n)) then  f(n) = O(h(n)) <br></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Groups of Big-O</h2>

<pre>
Complexity    |    Sample algorithms

- O(N^2)      |    Enumerating all pairs from N items, insert sort
- O(NLog(N))  |    Quick sort, merge sort
- O(N)        |    Getting min, max, average, iterating over N items

<p>Performance optimization often increases program <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">complexity</a> and reduces its  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">maintainability</a>.  Reducing space requirements often means code running slower, while making code run faster often increases its memory demands, although the most profound algorithmic optimization will often improve on both aspects.</p>
<p>A commonly cited peril is <em>&quot;premature optimization&quot;</em> (&quot;the root of all evil&quot;, as the saying goes).  In contrast, the most dramatic effect on optimization is at the <strong>Design Level</strong> via <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">algorithm efficiency</a>; this is the earliest stage of development thus seemingly a paradox.</p>
<p>The way to resolve this paradox is to consider the correct order of implementations. Correctness should come first (thus starting with the simplest, most self-evidently correct code), algorithmic improvements second, performance-improving &quot;micro-optimizations&quot; come last. &quot;<em>Premature</em> optimization&quot; means focusing on micro-optimizations right away before even formulating a correct solution (which often leads to altogether wrong, though efficiently so, code); or before considering algorithmic optimizations which, if possible, would obviate those micro-optimizations in the first place.</p>
<p>When using this tag, i.e. asking about optimization, please state the optimization goal you have in mind. The lists above illustrate that many possible optimization goals are mutually exclusive (e.g. performance vs simplicity / maintainability). It is hence not possible to optimize for everything; and optimizing without a clear goal is another common peril and makes a question too broad or unclear.</p>

In many implementations, identifiers can be disambiguated between namespaces by prepending the identifier with the namespace, separated by a delimiter such as a period (<code>.</code>) in <a href=""/questions/tagged/java"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;java&#39;"" rel=""tag"">java</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%23"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c#&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c#</a>, double-colon (<code>::</code>) in <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a> or backslash (<code>\</code>) in <a href=""/questions/tagged/php-5.3"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;php-5.3&#39;"" rel=""tag"">php-5.3</a>.</p>

<p>For many programming languages, namespace is a context for their identifiers. In an operating system, an example of namespace is a directory. Each name in a directory uniquely identifies one file or subdirectory, but one file may have the same name multiple times.</p>

<p>As a rule, names in a namespace cannot have more than one meaning; that is, different meanings cannot share the same name in the same namespace. A namespace is also called a context, because the same name in different namespaces can have different meanings, each one appropriate for its namespace.</p>

<p>Following are other characteristics of namespaces:</p>

<ul>
<li>Names in the namespace can represent objects as well as concepts, be the namespace a natural or ethnic language, a constructed language, the technical terminology of a profession, a dialect, a sociolect, or an artificial language (e.g., a programming language).</li>
<li>In the Java programming language, identifiers that appear in namespaces have a short (local) name and a unique long ""qualified"" name for use outside the namespace.</li>
<li>Some compilers (for languages such as C++) combine namespaces and names for internal use in the compiler in a process called name mangling.</li>
</ul>

<h1>PHP</h1>

<p>Namespaces were introduced into PHP from version 5.3 onwards.  In PHP, a namespace is defined with a namespace block.</p>

<pre><code>namespace phpstar {
    class fooBar {
        public function foo() {
            echo 'hello world, from function foo';
        }

        public function bar() {
            echo 'hello world, from function bar';
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h1>XML</h1>

<p>In XML, the XML namespace specification enables the names of elements and attributes in an XML document to be unique. Using XML namespaces, XML documents may contain element or attribute names from more than one XML vocabulary.</p>

<h1>Python</h1>

<p>In Python, namespaces are defined by the individual modules, and since modules can be contained in hierarchical packages, then name spaces are hierarchical as well. In general when a module is imported then the names defined in the module are defined via that module's name space, and are accessed in from the calling modules by using the fully qualified name.</p>

<h1>.NET</h1>

<p>All .NET Framework classes are organized in namespaces. When referencing a class, one should specify either its fully qualified name, which means namespace followed by the class name,</p>

<h1>C++</h1>

<p>In C++, a namespace is defined with a namespace block.</p>

<pre><code>namespace abc {
    int bar;
}

  <p>A hyperlink has an anchor, which is the location within a document from which the hyperlink can be followed; the document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document. The target of a hyperlink is the document, or location within a document, to which the hyperlink leads.

<h2>Memory allocation</h2>
<p>The specifics of variable allocation and the representation of their values vary widely, both among programming languages and among implementations of a given language. Many language implementations allocate space for local variables (whose extent lasts for a single function call) on the stack, and their memory is automatically reclaimed when the function returns. More generally, in name binding, the name of a variable is bound to the address of some particular block (contiguous sequence) of bytes in memory, and operations on the variable manipulate that block. Referencing is more common for variables whose values have large or unknown sizes when the code is compiled. Such variables reference the location of the value instead of storing the value itself, which is allocated from a pool of memory called the heap.</p>

<h3>Set theory</h3>

<p>Null is another name for the empty set, denoted by the symbol â.  For this reason, some programming languages use <code>null</code> or <code>nil</code> for the empty list or empty tuple.  Lisp uses <code>nil</code> to mean the empty list and the boolean value false.</p>

<h3>Pointers and References</h3>

<p><code>Null</code> (or sometimes <code>nil</code> or <code>None</code>), in programming languages that support it, is the value of an uninitialized variable, a pointer that doesn't point to a meaningful memory address, or an object that fails to respond to any message.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nullable references were invented by C.A.R. Hoare in 1965 as part of the Algol W language. Hoare later described his invention as a ""billion-dollar mistake"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For more information, see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Null pointer</a>.</p>

<p>Agreeing with Hoare's sentiment, many languages don't have a special <code>null</code> value, choosing to use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">optional types</a> instead.</p>

<h3>Relational Databases</h3>

<p><code>NULL</code> as a special marker in SQL or a relational database stands in place of a value that is missing,  or in a join means ""no corresponding row."" The operators <code>IS NULL</code> and <code>IS NOT NULL</code> are required for comparisons to a literal <code>null</code>: other comparisons between <code>NULL</code> and any value evaluate to ""unknown.""</p>

<p><code>Null</code> or <code>NUL</code> is the name given to the character with ASCII code zero (<code>0</code>) - i.e. hex <code>00</code>. In some languages, notably C, <code>NUL</code> is used to mark the end of a character string.</p>

<p>A typical usage scenario with this tag is that you have a problem and you don't know <strong>how</strong> to solve much less <strong>what</strong> to write in a specific programming language.</p>
<p>So you would first ask a <strong>how</strong> type question with the tag <a href=""/questions/tagged/language-agnostic"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;language-agnostic&#39;"" rel=""tag"">language-agnostic</a> and usually <a href=""/questions/tagged/algorithm"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;algorithm&#39;"" rel=""tag"">algorithm</a>. Then when you get an acceptable answer you would code it in a specific programming language. If you have problems then you can refer back to the related question with the tag <a href=""/questions/tagged/language-agnostic"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;language-agnostic&#39;"" rel=""tag"">language-agnostic</a> then in the new <strong>what</strong> question add the specific programming language, e.g. <a href=""/questions/tagged/javascript"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;"" rel=""tag"">javascript</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/python"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python</a></p>

A file is durable in the sense that it remains available for programs to use after the current program has finished. Computer files can be considered as the modern counterpart of paper documents which traditionally are kept in offices' and libraries' files, and this is the source of the term.</p>
<p>In modern computer architectures, files are organized in a tree structure.
On the top, you have a root like C:\ in <a href=""/questions/tagged/windows"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;windows&#39;"" rel=""tag"">windows</a> systems. There are several subfolders (inner nodes) below the root, e.g. Program Files or Users.

<p>On <a href=""/questions/tagged/unix"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;unix&#39;"" rel=""tag"">unix</a> based systems, many types of system information are also represented as files, in filesystems such as sysfs and devfs, even though they don't represent information on a durable storage medium.</p>

"5","5253711","","","<p><em>Authentication</em> is the process of providing a proof of identity or verifying identity. This might involve confirming the identity of a person or software program, tracing the origins of an artifact, or ensuring that a product is what its packaging and labeling claims to be. Authentication is different than Authorization, which is the step of allowing access to a resource. Authentication and authorization usually happen together to verify identity and then allow access.</p>
<p>The <strong>first type</strong> of authentication is accepting proof of identity given by a credible person who has evidence on the said identity, or on the originator and the object under assessment as the originator's artifact respectively.</p>
<p>The <strong>second type</strong> of authentication is comparing the attributes of the object itself to what is known about objects of that origin. For example, an art expert might look for similarities in the style of painting, check the location and form of a signature, or compare the object to an old photograph.</p>
<p>The <strong>third type</strong> of authentication relies on documentation or other external affirmations.</p>
<h2>Factors and identity</h2>
<p>The ways in which someone may be authenticated fall into three categories, based on what is known as the factors of authentication: something the <em>user knows</em>, something the <em>user has</em>, and something the <em>user is</em>. Each authentication factor covers a range of elements used to authenticate or verify a person's identity prior to being granted access, approving a transaction request, signing a document or other work product, granting authority to others, and establishing a chain of authority.</p>

"5","5276945","","","<p>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_%28data_structure%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stack</a> is a data structure, often used as an abstract data type (ADT) in many programming languages, to store data in a last in, first out (LIFO) manner. You could imagine it like a stack of cards. If you put a card onto the top of the stack, and then take the top card off the stack, you'll get the same card you put onto it.</p>

<p>Putting data onto a stack is called pushing. Taking something from a stack is called popping. Checking what's on top of a stack without removing it is called peeking.</p>

<p>Here is an example program:</p>

<pre><code>a = new stack()
a.push(5)
b = a.peek()
print(b)
a.push(6)
b = a.pop()
print(b)
b = a.pop()
print(b)
</code></pre>

<p>would give the output:</p>

<pre><code>5
6
5
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href=""/questions/tagged/callstack"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;callstack&#39;"" rel=""tag"">callstack</a> is a stack data structure that's used to keep track of local variables and allows easy nested function calls (including for recursive functions).  The current top-of-stack is usually tracked by a dedicated <a href=""/questions/tagged/stack-pointer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;stack-pointer&#39;"" rel=""tag"">stack-pointer</a> register.  Different CPU architectures and calling conventions manage the stack differently, but it's common to push a return address as part of calling a function. Returning pops the return address and jumps to it, allowing a function to return to wherever it was called from.</p>

  <p>A checkbox is a graphical user interface element that permits the user

"5","5312569","","","<p>A hash map (or hash table) is a data structure which contains ""key-value"" pairs and allows retrieving values by key.</p>

<p>The most attractive feature is fast lookup of elements, particularly for large numbers of elements. Hash maps work by using a hash function to transform keys into a hash number that is then used as an index into an array of ""buckets"" containing one or more elements. This allows constant time access to the relevant bucket, followed by a linear search for the desired element within the bucket.  When the number of elements in each bucket is kept low (possibly by dynamically resizing the array of buckets as elements are inserted) this offers constant time lookup on average even when the number of elements in the hash map increases. This can be a significant advantage compared to lookup in a tree-based structures which needs to perform more steps as the number of elements increases.</p>

<p>A drawback of hash tables is that elements are not stored in an obvious or meaningful order, as a good hash function will not map neighbouring keys to neighbouring buckets.</p>

<p>If many mappings are to be stored in a <code>HashMap</code> instance, creating it with a sufficiently large capacity will allow the mappings to be stored more efficiently than letting it perform automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.</p>

<p>Note that this implementation is not synchronized. If multiple threads access a hash map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a structural modification.) This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map. If no such object exists, the map should be ""wrapped"" using the Collections.synchronizedMap method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the map:</p>

<pre><code>Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...));
</code></pre>

<p>The iterators returned by all of this class's ""collection view methods"" are fail-fast: if the map is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own remove method, the iterator will throw a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code>. Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.</p>

<p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators throw <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code> on a best-effort basis. Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators should be used only to detect bugs.</p>

<p>This class is a member of the Java Collections Framework. </p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Exception handling</a> is a programming language construct or computer hardware mechanism designed to handle the occurrence of exceptions, special conditions that change the normal flow of program execution. When such conditions occur the programmer can decide to &quot;throw&quot; or &quot;raise&quot; an exception. The thrown exception will propagate up the stack until &quot;caught&quot; by an appropriate language construct, which usually contains code that deals with the situation. Unhandled exceptions usually lead to abnormal termination.</p>
<p>Programming languages differ considerably in their support for exception handling (as distinct from error checking, which is normal program flow that checks for contingencies such as unsuccessful termination of invoked operations). In some programming languages, there are functions that cannot be safely called on invalid input data, or functions that return values which cannot be distinguished from exceptions. For example, in <a href=""/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> the <code>atoi</code> (ASCII to integer conversion) function may return 0 (zero) for any input that cannot be parsed into a valid value. In such languages, the programmer must either perform error checking (possibly through some auxiliary global variable such as C's <code>errno</code>) or input validation (perhaps using regular expressions) or both.</p>
<p>Exception handling is built upon three keywords: try, catch, and throw.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>try:</code> A <code>try</code> block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions will be activated. It is followed by one or more <code>catch</code>
blocks.</li>
<li><code>throw:</code> A program throws an exception when a problem shows up. This
is done using the <code>throw</code> keyword.</li>
<li><code>catch:</code> A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you want to handle the problem. The <code>catch</code> keyword indicates the catching of an exception.</li>
</ul>
<p>A method catches an exception using a combination of the <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code> keywords. A try/catch block is placed around the code that might generate an exception. Code within a try/catch block is referred to as protected code, and the syntax for using try/catch looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code>try
{
   // protected code
}
catch( ExceptionName e1 )
{
   // catch block
}
catch( ExceptionName e2 )
{
   // catch block
}
catch( ExceptionName eN )
{
   // catch block
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can provide multiple catch statements to catch different types of exceptions in case your try block raises more than one type of exception.</p>
<h2>Exception safety</h2>
<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_safety"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Exception safety</a>, as formalised by David Abrahams, guarantees a set of contract guidelines that an interface (or operation) offers w.r.t. the state of the program if an exception occurs.</p>
<ol>
<li>No-throw guarantee: the operation is guaranteed not to fail</li>
<li>Strong exception safety: if the operation fails, the state will be as it was prior to the failure (rollback semantics)</li>
<li>Basic exception safety: no leaks will occur, and data is left in a valid state (but possibly changed)</li>
<li>No exception safety: no guarantees are made.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Automated exception handling</h2>
<p>Automated exception handling is a computing term referring to the computerized handling of errors. Runtime engines such as those for the Java language or Microsoft .NET lend themselves to an automated mode of exception or error handling. In these environments, software errors do not &quot;crash&quot; the program or operating system but rather generate exceptions. Recent advances in these runtime engines enable specialized runtime-engine add-on products to provide automated exception handling that is independent of the source code and provides root-cause information for every exception of interest.</p>

Normally, an exception should not result in total failure, but instead be attended by an exception handler. Exception handling is a built-in construct in many programming languages. Usually, exceptions are handled by unwinding the stack, thus rolling back to a defined state outside the exception's scope, and then invoking a handler block or routine.","572743","0","","","","2011-03-15 18:46:32"
"5","5329240","","","<p>Objects in object-oriented programming (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OOP</a>) are data structures combined with the associated processing routines. Classes are sets of objects, while objects are instances of sets. Objects have members and methods, defining their properties and their abilities. Classes can have their own members and methods, which define the properties and abilities of the set of objects. For instance, if we have a Bird class, its objects might have an age property and a fly ability, while the Bird class might have a number of birds or a migrate ability, which is applicable for the set. Class-level methods are called static, or shared. For instance, a file could be represented as an object: a collection of data and the associated read and write routines. In typical object-oriented languages, all objects are instances of classes.</p>

<h3>Properties of an object</h3>

<p>Three properties characterize objects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identity: the property of an object that distinguishes it from other objects</li>
<li>State: describes the data stored in the object</li>
<li>Behavior: describes the methods in the object's interface by which the object can be used</li>

<p>Almost every programming language provides support for list data structures. They are particularly common in functional languages, because their inductive properties lend themselves to elegant iterative and recursive abstractions.</p>

<p><strong>Performance:</strong></p>

<p>The flexibility of linked lists is somewhat offset by the complexity of some operations on lists (accessing an element at index <em>n</em> in a linked list is <em>O(n)</em>, while for arrays it is <em>O(1)</em>). In practice, linked lists are a very disadvantageous structure for random-access-based algorithms. Linked lists support quick <em>O(1)</em> appends, dynamic arrays also support <em>O(1)</em> appends however this <em>O(1)</em> runtime is amortized as it must factor in the periodical re-sizing of the dynamic array. The performance of lists and arrays is of the same order (<em>O</em>) for operations that deal with every element of the list in order.</p>

<p><strong>Types</strong></p>

<p>Lists are the canonical recursive (or inductive) data type.</p>

The basic components of an operational system can be listed as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Boot loader</strong> </p>

<p>Although some may say it is not part of the OS, it's the starting point where the hardware after doing booting routines transfers the control to a small procedure that will bring up the entire system</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User interface</strong></p>

<p>Can be graphical or text-based, is the central point of communication between the user and the OS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kernel</strong></p>

<p>The core of the OS that manages all the resources of the hardware according to the requisitions. Kernels can be either a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">micro kernel</a> or a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">monolithic kernel</a>.  Both types include the following functionality: </p>

<ul>
<li>Process management (scheduling, multitasking, pseudo-parallelism, and so on)</li>
<li>Memory (and virtual memory) management</li>
<li>Inter-process communications (IPC)</li>
<li>Interrupt management<br/><br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Monolithic kernels include these additional features:</p>

<ul>
<li>File system and disk access organization</li>
<li>Device management (with the aid of device drivers, plug-and-play routines, dynamic modules, and so on)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>These features are not included directly in a micro-kernel, but are instead implemented in tasks. One example of a fairly widely used micro-kernel is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">QNX</a>. As well, many <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hypervisors</a> are micro kernel designs.  A major argument for micro-kernels is that their small size makes them easier to analyze and more secure.<sup><a href=""http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/reliable-os/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tanenbaum</a></sup></p>

<p>Most well known operating systems are <em>monolithic</em>.  In fact, the majority of commercial and Open source OS's are monolithic.  Generally they allow faster hardware response.</p>

The time complexity of an algorithm is commonly expressed using <strong>big O notation</strong>, which suppresses multiplicative constants and lower order terms.</p>

<p>When expressed this way, the time complexity is said to be described asymptotically, i.e., as the input size goes to infinity. For example, if the time required by an algorithm on all inputs of size n is at most <code>5n^3 + 3n</code>, the asymptotic time complexity is <code>O(n^3)</code>.</p>

<p>Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, where an elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm differ by at most a constant factor.</p>

<p>Since an algorithm may take a different amount of time even on inputs of the same size, the most commonly used measure of time complexity, the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm, denoted as <strong><code>T(n)</code></strong>, is the maximum amount of time taken on any input of size <code>n</code>. Time complexities are classified by the nature of the function <code>T(n)</code>.</p>

<p>For instance, an algorithm with <code>T(n) = O(n)</code> is called a <em>linear time algorithm</em>, and an algorithm with <code>T(n) = O(2^n)</code> is said to be an <em>exponential time algorithm</em>.</p>

<p>Modern email operates across the Internet or other computer networks. Some early email systems required that the sender and the recipient both be online at the same time - a system currently known as Instant messaging. Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need connect only briefly, typically to an email server, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The current URL Standard at <a href=""https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-representation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-representation</a> supersedes RFC 3986 and dispenses with the use of the term <em>URI</em>, as documented in its Goals section:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Standardize on the term URL. URI and IRI are just confusing. In practice a single algorithm is used for both so keeping them distinct is not helping anyone. URL also easily wins the search result popularity contest.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>But the information below documents <em>URI</em> in terms of the legacy RFC 3986 spec.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>A URI can be a Uniform Resource Locator <a href=""/questions/tagged/url"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;url&#39;"" rel=""tag"">url</a>, a Uniform Resource Name <a href=""/questions/tagged/urn"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;urn&#39;"" rel=""tag"">urn</a>, or both.</p>

<p><a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 3986</a> defines a URI as composed of the following parts:</p>

<pre><code>    foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
    \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
     |           |            |            |        |
  scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
</code></pre>

<p>Then defining relative URIs (<a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5.2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Section 5.2</a>), you can omit any of those sections, always starting from the left. In pseudo-code, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code> result = """"

  if defined(scheme) then
     append scheme to result;
     append "":"" to result;
  endif;

  if defined(authority) then
     append ""//"" to result;
     append authority to result;
  endif;

  append path to result;

  if defined(query) then
     append ""?"" to result;
     append query to result;
  endif;

  if defined(fragment) then
     append ""#"" to result;
     append fragment to result;
  endif;

  return result;
</code></pre>

<p>The URI you are describing is a scheme-less relative URI.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>For example, in the following URI:</p>

<pre><code>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/uri?sort=newest&amp;pagesize=50#questions
</code></pre>

<p>... the components are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>scheme:</em> <code>https</code></p></li>
<li><p><em>hierarchical part:</em> <code>//stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/uri</code></p></li>
<li><p><em>query:</em> <code>sort=newest&amp;pagesize=50</code></p></li>
<li><p><em>fragment:</em> <code>questions</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The precise syntax of the individual components varies depending on the scheme. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>mailto:nobody@example.com?subject=Hello&amp;body=Is%20anybody%20home%3F</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>urn:ietf:rfc:3986</code></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>URL</h2>

<p>A URL is a URI but is more specific.  In addition to identifying a web resource, a URL specifies the means of acting upon or obtaining the representation, specifying both its primary access mechanism and network location. </p>

<p>For example, the URL <a href=""http://example.org/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://example.org/wiki/Main_Page</a> refers to a resource identified as /wiki/Main_Page whose representation, in the form of HTML and related code, obtainable via HyperText Transfer Protocol (http) from a network host whose domain name is example.org.</p>

<h2>URI Reference</h2>

<p>A URI reference may take the form of a full URI, or just the scheme-specific portion of one, or even some trailing component thereof â even the empty string. An optional fragment identifier, preceded by #, may be present at the end of a URI reference. The part of the reference before the # indirectly identifies a resource, and the fragment identifier identifies some portion of that resource.</p>

<p>To derive a URI from a URI reference, software converts the URI reference to 'absolute' form by merging it with an absolute 'base' URI according to a fixed algorithm. The system treats the URI reference as relative to the base URI, although in the case of an absolute reference, the base has no relevance. The base URI typically identifies the document containing the URI reference, although this can be overridden by declarations made within the document or as part of an external data transmission protocol. If the base URI includes a fragment identifier, it is ignored during the merging process. If a fragment identifier is present in the URI reference, it is preserved during the merging process.</p>

<p>Web document markup languages frequently use URI references to point to other resources, such as external documents or specific portions of the same logical document.</p>

<h3>Uses of URI references in markup languages</h3>

<ul>
<li>In HTML, the value of the src attribute of the img element provides a URI reference, as does the value of the href attribute of the a or link element.</li>
<li>In XML, the system identifier appearing after the SYSTEM keyword in a DTD is a fragmentless URI reference.</li>
<li>In XSLT, the value of the href attribute of the xsl:import element/instruction is a URI reference; likewise the first argument to the document() function.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples of absolute URIs</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://example.org/absolute/URI/with/absolute/path/to/resource.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://example.org/absolute/URI/with/absolute/path/to/resource.txt</a></li>

Text-based programming languages are based on sequences of characters, while visual programming languages are based on the spatial layout and connections between symbols (which may be textual or graphical).</p>
  
  <p>The lexical grammar of a textual language specifies how characters must be chunked into tokens. Other syntax rules specify the permissible sequences of these tokens and the process of assigning meaning to these token sequences is part of semantics.</p>
  
  <p>The syntactic analysis of source code usually entails the transformation of the linear sequence of tokens into a hierarchical syntax tree (abstract syntax trees are one convenient form of syntax tree). This process is called parsing, as it is in syntactic analysis in linguistics. Tools have been written that automatically generate parsers from a specification of a language grammar written in Backus-Naur form, e.g., Yacc (yet another compiler compiler).</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>On StackOverflow, questions should be tagged as syntax when the question specifically and almost completely relates to syntax alone. Additionally, a tag should be added corresponding to the language that is being used, as the syntax only makes sense in the context of the language. Adding the correct language tag will ensure that the question will reach an audience capable of answering it.</p>

<h2>JavaScript closure</h2>

<p>A basic example of closure in JavaScript can be shown with a counter:</p>

<pre><code>function increment () {
    var count = 0;
    return function () { // returning function
         count++; // increment the count
         return count;
    };
}

var foo = increment(); // foo is now a closure function, where count = 0
foo(); // calls the closure which yields 1
</code></pre>

<p>The reason why <code>increment</code> is considered to be a closure is because it's a local variable. In this case, <code>count</code> is persisting when assigned to the variable <code>foo</code>. This persistence occurs because the context of <code>foo</code> is taken from increment when it's declared.</p>

<p>The key point with a closure is that the environment of the function is 'closed' to a hosting object.</p>

<pre><code>var bar = increment(); // bar is now another closure function, with count initialized to 0
bar(); // calls the closure which yields 1, not 2.
</code></pre>

<h2>JQuery closures</h2>

<p>A more practical example of a closure is the <code>jQuery</code> library. jQuery itself is one big closure. It's declared like this:</p>

<pre><code>var jQuery = (function() { // Here is the closure
    // Define a local copy of jQuery
    var jQuery = function( selector, context ) {
        // The jQuery object is actually just the init constructor 'enhanced'.
        return new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context, rootjQuery );
    },
    ...
}) ( window );
</code></pre>

<p>Let's take a deeper look at this. jQuery's closure is actually an immediately invoked function expression or a closure that is immediately called. Let's take our original increment example and represent it in the form that jQuery uses:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = (function () {
    var count = 0;
    return function () {
        count++; // Increment the count
        return count;
    };
}) ();

foo(); // Yields 1
</code></pre>

<p>At first glance, this looks quite a bit different from our original example, but take another look. The only difference is that this example is wrapped in parentheses. <code>(function () {...}) ();</code>. These parentheses are returning the result of what's inside of them.</p>

<p>The first parentheses are returning a function that has <code>count = 0</code>. This is the same as calling <code>increment()</code> in our first example and the second set of parentheses is calling the returned function.</p>

Complexity functions may measure different quantities, such as time or space:</p>

"5","5828025","","","<p>A time zone is a region on Earth that has a uniform, legally mandated standard time.  As legal definitions of zones can vary wildly and change often, a database or lookup table is often required to properly apply time zone rules.</p>
<h1 id=""general-information-about-time-zones"">General Information About Time Zones</h1>
<p>Almost all time zones on land have legally defined borders which coincide with the borders of the country mandating the time or some subdivision thereof. Of the time zones on land, most have a standard-time offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by a whole number of hours (UTCâ12 to UTC+14), but several are offset by 30 or 45 minutes from a nearby hourly offset.</p>
<p>In addition to land time zones, there are 25 nautical time zones, all separated by lines of longitude. Most (UTCâ11 to UTC+11) are 15Â° of longitude wide, which is one hour of Earth's rotation relative to the Sun, but an hourly zone in the central Pacific Ocean is split into two 7.5Â° wide zones (UTCÂ±12) by the 180th meridian, part of which coincides with the International Date Line. Many land time zones are skewed toward the west relative to the corresponding nautical time zones.</p>
<p>Before 1972, all time zones were specified as an offset from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), which was the mean solar time at the meridian passing through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London, United Kingdom. Since 1972, all official time services have broadcast radio time signals synchronized to UTC, a form of atomic time that includes leap seconds to keep it within 0.9 seconds of this former GMT, now called UT1. Many countries now legally define their standard time relative to UTC, although some still legally refer to GMT, including the United Kingdom itself. UTC, also called Zulu time, is used everywhere on Earth by astronomers and others who need to state the time of an event unambiguously.</p>
<p>Originally, all time on Earth was some local apparent solar time, the time on a sundial, so every city had its own time. When well-regulated mechanical clocks became widespread in the early 19th century, each city began to use some local mean solar time. The first time zone was created in 1847 by railroads on the island of Great Britain using GMT. Sandford Fleming of Canada proposed worldwide hourly time zones in 1879. By about 1900, almost all time on Earth was in the form of standard time zones, only some of which used a hourly offset from GMT. Many applied the time at a local astronomical observatory to an entire country, without any reference to GMT. It took many decades before all time on Earth was in the form of time zones referred to some &quot;standard offset&quot; from GMT/UTC. Nepal was the last country to adopt a standard offset, shifting slightly to UTC+5:45 in 1986. However, many countries have <em>changed</em> their standard offset since then, such as when North Korea shifted from UTC+9 to UTC+8:30 in 2015.</p>
<p>A related concept is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/dst/info"">Daylight saving time</a> or Summer Time, which is an advance of (usually) one hour, mandated by many countries between spring and autumn.</p>
<h1 id=""time-zone-offset"">Time Zone != Offset</h1>
<p>A time zone can not be represented solely by an offset from UTC.  Many time zones have more than one offset due to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/dst/info"">daylight saving time</a> (aka &quot;summer time&quot;) rules.  The dates that offsets change are also part of the rules for the time zone, as are any historical offset changes.  Many software programs, libraries, and web services disregard this important detail, and erroneously call the standard or current offset the &quot;zone&quot;.  This can lead to confusion, and misuse of the data.  Please use the correct terminology whenever possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>offset</strong> is just a number that represents how far a particular date/time value is ahead or behind UTC.
<ul>
<li>Most offsets are expressed in whole hours.</li>
<li>But there are many that are 30-minute offset.</li>
<li>And there are a <em>few</em> that are 45-minute offset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <strong>time zone</strong> contains much more:
<ul>
<li>A name or ID that can be used to identify the zone.</li>
<li>One or more offsets from UTC</li>
<li>The specific dates and times that the zone transitions between offsets.</li>
<li>Sometimes, a separate language-specific display name that can be presented to a user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One can determine the correct offset, given a time zone and a datetime.  But one <em>cannot</em> determine the correct time zone given just an offset.</p>
<h1 id=""time-zone-abbreviations"">Time Zone Abbreviations</h1>
<p>Many times you will see a time zone abbreviated using three or more letters, such as <code>PST</code> to abbreviate &quot;Pacific Standard Time&quot;.   However, there are many problems with time zone abbreviations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They are often ambiguous.  For example, there are <em>five</em> different interpretations of <code>CST</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Central Standard Time (North America)</li>
<li>Central Standard Time (Australia)</li>
<li>Central Summer Time (Australia)</li>
<li>China Standard Time</li>
<li>Cuba Standard Time</li>
</ul>
<p>See also, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_time_zone_abbreviations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">list of Time Zone Abbreviations on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At best, they only represent a time zone offset, not a time zone.  For example, the US Pacific Time Zone is abbreviated <code>PST</code> during <em>Pacific Standard Time</em>, but uses <code>PDT</code> during <em>Pacific Daylight Time</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Abbreviations tend to be based on <em>English</em>. Sometimes there is a valid abbreviation in another language, and it may be confusing which to use.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some time zones may never actually <em>use</em> the abbreviation in the region where the time zone is observed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, if an abbreviation is used, it should be for display purposes.  An abbreviation should never be parsed, or looked up in a list of values (with the exception of &quot;UTC&quot; or &quot;GMT&quot;).</p>
<h1 id=""time-zone-databases"">Time Zone Databases</h1>
<p>There are two different time zone databases commonly used in computing:</p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/gp/cp_dst"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Microsoft Windows Time Zone Database</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Example Identifier: <code>&quot;Eastern Standard Time&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can obtain a list of these time zones by any of these methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Examine the Windows registry key at:<br />
<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Use the <code>tzutil.exe /l</code> command line utility, looking at the second line of each result.<br />
(The first line is the <em>display name</em>.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Call <code>TimeZoneInfo.GetSystemTimeZones</code> from .NET, looking at the <code>Id</code> property of the resulting <code>TimeZoneInfo</code> objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Call the <code>EnumDynamicTimeZoneInformation</code> Win32 function, looking at the <code>TimeZoneKeyName</code> field of the resulting <code>DYNAMIC_TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION</code> objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>DO NOT USE STATIC LISTS FROM WEB PAGES THAT LIST THESE WINDOWS TIME ZONES, INCLUDING THOSE FROM MICROSOFT.</strong>  These should be ignored and not linked to or used as reference material. This is because time zones change over time and the lists have been modified significantly.  In particular, several lists produced by Microsoft listing &quot;time zone index values&quot; only refer to time zones as they were for Windows Embedded 1.1, which has long been deprecated.  Another list by Microsoft lists only the default time zone values per country when installing Windows for the first time.
Third party lists are also suspect.  Instead, use one of the aforementioned methods to list time zones on an up-to-date Windows system.*</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Built in to Windows operating system.</li>
<li>Updates are deployed automatically through Windows Update.</li>
<li>Easy to consume from Win32 or .NET Framework on Windows.</li>
<li>As of <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3162835"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the June 2016 update</a>, covers everywhere on Earth, except for a few research stations in Antarctica.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintained by Microsoft instead of a standards body or community.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Zones tend to be broad, covering multiple countries and locations, instead of refined to a specific narrow location.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data for past years does not generally reach back very far into history, and is inconsistent with regard to starting year for the data that it does have for each time zone.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Interoperability with non-Microsoft platforms can be painful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Updated monthly at best - which may or may not be frequent enough to deal with a short-notice change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously, many changes were released only as hotfixes, but this has been changed in recent years such that all changes are deployed as regular updates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Identifiers and names are confusing and assigned haphazardly.  Naming conventions have varied over the years, and there is little consistency.  In general, do not rely on a Windows time zone identifier to mean anything in particular.  Instead, choose a time zone based on its <em>display name</em>.</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Eastern Standard Time&quot; refers to both EST <em>and</em> EDT.</li>
<li>&quot;Mountain Standard Time&quot; is for MST/MDT while &quot;US Mountain Standard Time&quot; is for Arizona which is fixed to MST.</li>
<li>&quot;US Eastern Standard Time&quot; <em>does</em> have daylight saving time, from 2006 forward (but not for 2005 or earlier).  It's used in the majority of Indiana.</li>
<li>&quot;Romance Standard Time&quot; is just a synonym for Central European Time.</li>
<li>&quot;GMT Standard Time&quot; refers to the time in the UK and Ireland that alternates between GMT (UTC+0) and BST or IST (UTC+1), rather than strictly referring to GMT itself.  (For GMT year-round, use the identifier &quot;UTC&quot; instead.)</li>
<li>&quot;W.

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>As mentioned above, Windows time zones also have a <em>display name</em>.<br />

<ul>
<li>These names contain a time zone offset, but those offsets represent the <em>standard</em> time offset, not the <em>current</em> offset.  This can be confusing, as the offset listed may not be the actual one in effect.</li>
<li>The display names are localized by the language settings of the Windows operating system.  When used via <code>TimeZoneInfo</code> in .NET, the localizations are not updated to reflect the current culture or current UI culture.   For example, you might have an application that serves data to an English speaking user, but when hosted on a Japanese server, the time zone display names will be presented in Japanese.</li>

<p><strong>Role of the CLDR</strong></p>
<p>The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository maintains localized translations of IANA/Olson time zone names, as well as mapping between Microsoft Windows identifiers and IANA/Olson identifiers.</p>
<p>The mapping data is available <a href=""https://unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/zone_tzid.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in the second table on this page</a>, or <a href=""https://unicode.org/repos/cldr/trunk/common/supplemental/windowsZones.xml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in xml format here</a>.  Note that there is usually more than one possible IANA/Olson zone for any given Windows zone.  So one can translate an Olson zone to a single Windows zone, but the other direction will yield more than one possible choice.  Also note that while every Windows zone is mapped, not every IANA/Olson zone is.  So it is always possible to go from a Windows zone to (one or more) IANA/Olson zones - but not necessarily the other way around.</p>

<h1 id=""posix-style-time-zones"">POSIX style time zones</h1>
<p>Prior to acceptance of the time zone databases, the standard way to describe time zones was defined by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">POSIX</a> specification, as set in the <code>TZ</code> <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">environment variable</a>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PST8PDT</code></li>
<li><code>CET-1CEST,M3.5.0/2,M10.5.0/3</code></li>
<li><code>GRNLNDST3GRNLNDDT,M10.3.0/00:00:00,M2.4.0/00:00:00</code></li>
</ul>
<p>While this compact format allows for time zone rules to be expressed without a database, it has a few disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cannot express more than two transitions in a year, so it can't handle real-world events like <a href=""https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/clockchange.html?n=53&amp;year=2010"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Egypt in 2010</a> or <a href=""https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/clockchange.html?n=60&amp;year=2012"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Morocco in 2012</a>, <a href=""https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/clockchange.html?n=60&amp;year=2013"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2013</a>, and <a href=""https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/clockchange.html?n=60&amp;year=2014"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2014</a>.</li>
<li>Contains only the <em>current</em> time zone rules, so it cannot be used to accurately convert historical changes, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time_in_the_United_States#2005_Revision_to_dates_of_observance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">USA before 2007</a>.</li>
<li>Are sometimes cryptic and difficult to read.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, most environments that accepted a TZ variable, will now allow you to pass an IANA/Olson identifier instead.  For example, see the third option for <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/TZ-Variable.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">working with time zones in glibc</a>.</p>
<p>IBM has a good article about POSIX vs Olson time zone formats <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-aix-posix/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  (This was written for AIX, but is applicable in many other contexts.)</p>
<p>POSIX style time zones are still useful in some cases, such as on lightweight &quot;IoT&quot; devices where there is not enough storage space for a full IANA time zone implementation.  In such cases, a POSIX string for the <em>current</em> year can be generated by a back-end service that the device receives data from.  Of course, this should be updated periodically, as the string could change year-over-year, or even within the year.  On such library that can project POSIX strings from IANA data is <a href=""https://github.com/mattjohnsonpint/TimeZoneConverter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>TimeZoneConverter.Posix</code></a> for .NET.  There are other libraries and web services that can generate these values as well.</p>
<h1 id=""rails-time-zone-identifiers"">Rails Time Zone Identifiers</h1>
<p>If you are a Ruby on Rails developer, or if you use an API from an application that was created using Rails (such as Twitter), then you may encounter time zone identifiers in a slightly different format, such as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;Eastern Time (US &amp; Canada)&quot;</code> (instead of <code>&quot;America/New_York&quot;</code>)</li>
<li><code>&quot;London&quot;</code> (instead of <code>&quot;Europe/London&quot;</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These identifiers are defined by Rails in the <a href=""http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/TimeZone.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ActiveSupport::TimeZone</a> class.  <a href=""https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/values/time_zone.rb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The source code for this class is here.</a>  They are based on standard IANA/Olson time zones.  Rails describes them as &quot;a meaningful subset of 146 zones&quot;, however it does not describe by what criteria it determines a zone to be &quot;meaningful&quot;.</p>
<p>While these particular zones should work just fine within a Rails application, you may find it difficult to use them in other contexts.  For example, if you need to pass a time zone to a JavaScript library, or via a REST API to some third party, it may be difficult to consume them in Rails format. Rails developers should consider one of the two approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>When exposing a Rails time zone identifier externally, use the <code>ActiveSupport::TimeZone::MAPPING</code> constant, which defines a dictionary back to standard IANA/Olson zone identifers.</li>
<li>Use the Ruby <a href=""https://tzinfo.github.io"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TZinfo Gem</a> instead of <code>ActiveSupport::TimeZone</code>.  It provides access to the full IANA/Olson time zone database, and uses standard identifiers.</li>

(from Android's <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/overview.html#Layout"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UI Overview</a>)</p>

<h2>Designing a Layout:</h2>

<p>You can create your layout in any combination of these two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Declare UI elements in XML.</strong><br>
Android provides a straightforward XML vocabulary that corresponds to the <code>View</code> classes and subclasses, such as those for widgets and layouts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instantiate layout elements at runtime.</strong><br>
Your application can create <code>View</code> and <code>ViewGroup</code> objects (and manipulate their properties) programmatically.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Common Layouts:</h2>

<p>Each subclass of the ViewGroup class provides a unique way to display the views you nest within it. Below are some of the more common layout types that are built into the Android platform.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Linear Layout:</strong>
A layout that organizes its children into a single horizontal or vertical row. It creates a scrollbar if the length of the window exceeds the length of the screen.</li>
<li><strong>Relative Layout:</strong>
Enables you to specify the location of child objects relative to each other (child A to the left of child B) or to the parent (aligned to the top of the parent).</li>
<li><strong>Constraint Layout:</strong> 
Allows positioning children relative to each other and the parent. But also offers other powerful positioning and sizing strategies, including horizontal/vertical child ""chains"" with custom spacing/weighting, arbitrary horizontal/vertical ""guidelines,"" and custom child size aspect ratios.  </li>
<li><strong>Web View:</strong>
Displays web pages.</li>
<li><strong>Frame layout:</strong>
FrameLayout is designed to block out an area on the screen to display a single item.</li>
<li><strong>Grid View:</strong>
GridView is a ViewGroup that displays items in a two-dimensional, scrollable grid.</li>

"5","6016040","","","<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Memory management</a></strong> is the act of managing computer memory. The essential requirement of memory management is to provide ways to dynamically allocate portions of memory to programs at their request, and freeing it for reuse when no longer needed.</p>

<p>Memory management usually occurs at two distinct levels:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Virtual memory management</strong><br>
The operating system kernel manages the pages of physical memory and maps them into the virtual address spaces of processes at their request.</p>

<p>The following methods/algorithms fall into the category of virtual memory management:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Paging: The act of writing the contents of unused pages to disc in order to reuse the RAM page for other purposes (page out). When the data is needed again, the hardware issues an interrupt due to an unmapped memory address, which the kernel resolves by reading the page back from disc. Even though paging is entirely transparent to user space processes, it can severely slow a system down.</p></li>
<li><p>CoW (Copy on Write): Good implementations of the <code>fork()</code> system call will not copy the entire data of the process. Instead, only the page tables are copied, and all memory pages are marked as read-only. Whenever an access violation occurs because one of the forked processes tries to write to a memory page, the kernel just copies the contents of that page.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory mapped files: Memory pages do not need to be backed by the swap area, the may also be backed by files. Such memory mapped files may usually be paged out without writing anything to disc, because memory mapping is usually used as a means of input rather than output. Code sections from executables and libraries, for instance, are usually memory mapped, which avoids duplication of data in memory when several processes use the same executable/libraries. Memory mapping is also available to user space processes via the <code>mmap()</code> system call.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamic memory management</strong></p>

<p>This second level of memory management is local to every process, and is usually implemented by the standard C library (<code>malloc()</code>, <code>realloc()</code>, and <code>free()</code>). As a second level of memory management, <code>malloc()</code> relies on the <code>brk()</code> and <code>mmap()</code> system calls to request memory pages from the kernel. Large allocations are usually directly satisfied by an <code>mmap()</code> call. For small allocations, <code>malloc()</code> implementations keep track of mapped, unused memory, subdividing the unused memory as necessary to match the requests from the user code, and requesting new memory pages from the kernel whenever no suitable free memory block is found.</p>

<p>Common goals for dynamic memory allocators:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thread safety</p></li>
<li><p>No unnecessary memory fragmentation</p></li>
<li><p>Low amount of memory used for bookkeeping purposes</p></li>
<li><p>Low allocation/deallocation latencies</p>

<p>This includes optimizations of the search for suitable free blocks, and methods to reduce the amount of system calls.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Another method of memory management within a process is the function call stack. This is usually managed by manipulating a single, dedicated register in the CPU. On entry, every function changes the value of this stack pointer register to allocate stack memory for its local variables, and resets the stack pointer before it returns to its caller. This method of memory allocation is extremely fast, however, the lifetime of the objects on the stack is limited to the function that allocates them.</p>

<p>Stack memory may either be provided as a block of fixed size, or may be dynamically increased by the kernel whenever it notices an access violation just below the stack memory region.</p>

<p>Even though the kernel is not responsible to do dynamic memory management for the processes, it still needs to do so for itself, in LINUX, this is done by the <code>kmalloc()</code> function. Also, kernel threads need their own stacks. In contrast to the user space dynamic memory managers, the kernel facilities cannot rely on the virtual memory manager.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Common to virtual memory management and dynamic memory management is the necessity to know when a block of memory may be deallocated. There are three approaches to handle this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Explicit management: The user has to take care that every allocation call is matched by a deallocation call.</p></li>
<li><p>Reference counting: Some entity keeps track of how many times every memory block is referenced. The reference count may reside in the memory block itself, or somewhere outside of it. An important implementation of this is the <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;&gt;</code> in C++.</p></li>
<li><p>Garbage collection: Used in high level scripting languages and in Java. Memory is only allocated, never explicitly deallocated, deallocation is the job of the garbage collector which scans all used memory for references to memory block and automatically deallocates blocks that are not referenced anymore.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Several methods have been devised that increase the effectiveness of the different memory management facilities, as the quality of the involved memory managers can have an extensive effect on overall system performance.</p>

<p>In object-oriented programming, a method is a subroutine (or procedure) associated with a class. Methods define the behavior to be exhibited by instances of the associated class at program run time. </p>

<p>Methods have the special property that at runtime, they have access to data stored in an instance of the class (or class instance or class object or object) they are associated with and are thereby able to control the state of the instance. </p>

"5","6353966","","","<p>A path represents a unique file system location using the directory tree hierarchy expressed in a string of characters in which path components, separated by a delimiting character, represent each directory. The delimiting character is most commonly a slash <code>/</code>, a backslash <code>\</code>, or a colon <code>:</code>. </p>

<p>A <strong>PATH</strong> (all upper case, <a href=""/questions/tagged/environment-variables"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;environment-variables&#39;"" rel=""tag"">environment-variables</a>) in the Linux, UNIX-like operating systems and Windows contains list of directories, where the shell searches through, when a command is executed. The executables are stored in different directories in the OS. On UNIX-like OS the directories are separated by colon, on Windows by semi-colon.</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<p>Simple way to show the $PATH variable is:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""$PATH""
printf ""%s\n"" ""$PATH""
</code></pre>

<p>A typical <strong>PATH</strong> looks like:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>More generally, a path is a sequence of directions that, when followed in order, reach a certain object or location.</p>

<p>In addition to file system paths, there are paths through a tree:</p>

<pre><code>root-&gt;left-&gt;right-&gt;right-&gt;left
</code></pre>

<p>or, again more generally, a set of attributes on an object.</p>

<hr>

<p>There might be some other contexts where the term ""path"" is used to described something non-URI and non-directory related which are not covered by the general description.</p>

<p>One case would be in a context such as in the SCADA software, <code>Ignition</code>, where the term ""path"" is generally used to refer to <strong>tag-path</strong> - as <code>Tag</code> is the basic unit in the software, forming a hierarchical system like directory. Typical tag-path in Ignition look like this:</p>

<pre><code>BaseFolder/MyTag
</code></pre>

<p>Or, more complexly when tag is not in the <code>BaseFolder</code> but referred from another ""Parent"" <code>Tag</code>:</p>

<pre><code>BaseFolder/MyAdvanceUDTTag/MyBaseUDTTag/MyTag
</code></pre>

"5","6438128","","","<p>An <code>inner join</code> is the most common join operation used in applications and can be regarded as the default join-type. <code>Inner join</code> creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables (A and B) based upon the join-predicate. The query compares each row of A with each row of B to find all pairs of rows which satisfy the join-predicate.</p>

<p>When the join-predicate is satisfied, column values for each matched pair of rows of A and B are combined into a result row. The result of the join can be defined as the outcome of first taking the Cartesian product (or Cross join) of all records in the tables (combining every record in table A with every record in table B) then returning all records which satisfy the join predicate. </p>

<p>Actual SQL implementations normally use other approaches like a hash join or a sort-merge join where possible, since computing the Cartesian product is very inefficient.</p>

Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed files are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated. This is the default action. </p>

<p><code>--soft</code><br>
Does not touch the index file nor the working tree at all, but requires them to be in a good order. This leaves all your changed files ""Changes to be committed"", as git status would put it. </p>

<p><code>--hard</code><br>
Matches the working tree and index to that of the tree being switched to. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code> are lost. </p>

<p><code>--merge</code><br>
Resets the index to match the tree recorded by the named commit, and updates the files that are different between the named commit and the current commit in the working tree. </p>

<p><code>--keep</code><br>
Reset the index to the given commit, keeping local changes in the working tree since the current commit, while updating working tree files without local changes to what appears in the given commit. If a file that is different between the current commit and the given commit has local changes, reset is aborted. </p>

<p><code>-p</code>, <code>--patch</code><br>
Interactively select hunks in the difference between the index and <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code> (defaults to HEAD). The chosen hunks are applied in reverse to the index.  This means that git reset -p is the opposite of git add -p (see <a href=""/questions/tagged/git-add"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'git-add'"" rel=""tag"">git-add</a>). </p>

<p><code>-q</code>, <code>--quiet</code><br>
Be quiet, only report errors. </p>

<p><code>&lt;commit&gt;</code><br>
Commit to make the current HEAD. If not given defaults to HEAD.</p>

<h1>Gitignore grammar</h1>

<p>.gitignore interprets direct filenames and wildcards (<strong><em>both of which are recursive, front and back</em></strong>),</p>

<pre><code>file.name   # Will match file.name, foo/file.name, foo/bar/file.name, etc.
*.tmp       # Will match out.tmp, foo/out.tmp, etc.
cache/*.bak # Will match cache/out.bak, foo/cache/out.bak, etc.
</code></pre>

<p>This recursive behavior can be stopped by adding a leading <strong><em>/</em></strong> to the line.</p>

<pre><code>/file.name # Will only match toplevel file.name
/*.tmp     # Will only match toplevel tmp files
/cache/*.bak # Will only match bak files directly under cache
</code></pre>

<p>.gitignore will also do simple character classes.  </p>

<pre><code>foo.[abc] # foo.a, foo.b, and foo.c
</code></pre>

<p>It uses the <code>#</code> to denote comments.</p>

<pre><code># This comment goes until the end of the line
</code></pre>

<p>Certain files can also be excepted from wildcards by using the <code>!</code> syntax.</p>

<pre><code># Ignore all *.config files except the default that ships
*.config
!default.config
</code></pre>

<p>It is imperative to note that gitignore uses the unix <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fnmatch.3.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>fnmatch</code></a> style patterns to ignore files.</p>

<p>See the <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">man page</a> for more details.</p>

<p>To know which rule of which <code>.gitignore</code> is ignoring your file, use <a href=""https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ignore"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>git check-ignore</code></a> (since Git 1.8.3.3, July 2013):</p>

<p>A generator is a special routine that can be used to control the iteration behaviour of a loop. A generator is very similar to a function that returns an array, in that a generator has parameters, can be called, and generates a sequence of values. However, instead of building an array containing all the values and returning them all at once, a generator yields the values one at a time, which requires less memory and allows the caller to get started processing the first few values immediately. In short, a generator looks like a function but behaves like an iterator.</p>

<p>Generators can be implemented in terms of more expressive control flow constructs, such as coroutines or first-class continuations.</p>

<p>Initially released in 2009, <a href=""https://angularjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AngularJS</a> was developed and maintained by Google, and <a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-M5U0B6JI2JKU2ibVmU-xKkR7a88Uz1ZN0pc2lEuGzE/edit#slide=id.g48b143717_069"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">is used internally by Google in 1600+ applications</a>.</p>

Angular</a>). The [tag: angular] tag should only be used for questions

</blockquote>
<h3>AngularJS's Philosophy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Encourages developers to create their own directives, turning the HTML into a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DSL</a> suited to building their kind of application. The result significantly reduces the amount and complexity of JavaScript needed to build web applications.</li>
<li>UI is best described in the declarative form (HTML), and that behavior is best described in an imperative form (JavaScript) and that the two should never meet.</li>
<li>Encourages developers to design their client architecture using advanced software principles like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dependency injection</a> (DI), <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">separation of concerns</a> (SoC), testability, and a file structure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notable features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Teach your browser new tricks by adding behavior to HTML tags/attributes</li>
<li>Controllers provide code-behind DOM with clear separation from the view</li>
<li>Two-way data binding without the need to extend or wrap the model objects</li>
<li>Dependency injection assembles the application <a href=""https://blog.angularjs.org/2012/08/getting-rid-of-main.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">without <code>'main'</code> method</a></li>
<li>Promises/futures remove many callbacks from code when communicating with the server</li>
<li>Directives</li>
<li>Views and routes</li>
<li>Filters</li>
<li>Form validation</li>
<li>Strong focus on testability</li>
<li>Extend HTML with your own behavior</li>
<li>Angular uses spinal-case for its custom attributes and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">camelCase</a> for the corresponding directives which implement them</li>

<p>Specifically, the term command is used in imperative computer languages. These languages are called this, because statements in these languages are usually written in a manner similar to the imperative mood used in many natural languages. If one views a statement in an imperative language as being like a sentence in a natural language, then a command is generally like a verb in such a language.</p>

<p>Many programs allow specially formatted arguments, known as flags, which modify the default behaviour of the command, while further arguments describe what the command acts on. Comparing to a natural language: the flags are adverbs, whilst the other arguments are objects.</p>

<p>An <code>InputStream</code> is abstract, and doesn't describe the type of data that is being read. Typically you would implement one of the subclasses instead, such as <code>FileInputStream</code>, which more appropriately describes the type of data being handled, and provides additional methods appropriate for that data type.</p>

<p>Streamed data is typically consumed as it is read. In other words, you read the data from the stream starting from the first byte and ending at the last byte. You are usually able to skip over bytes that you don't want to handle, but you can't typically go back to a previous position in the stream, unless you implement some kind of buffering mechanism. In general, you should treat all streamed data as being once-only, and thus you should manually retain any information that you wish to refer to later.</p>

A container is an isolated package that contains everything, except for the kernel, needed to run a piece of software. Docker was originally written to work with Linux and has more recently been implemented on MS Windows. <a href=""https://www.docker.com/company"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Docker Inc.</a> is the company behind the open-source <code>docker</code> toolset.</p>
<p>Docker builds a high-level API over execution drivers, such as OpenVZ, systemd-nspawn, libvirt-lxc, libvirt, QEMU/KVM, BSD Jails, Solaris Zones, and chroot to run processes with some degree of isolation and repeatability across environments. The default execution driver since release 0.9 is Docker's own libcontainer driver. It's mainly written in <a href=""https://golang.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Go</a> and its source-code can be found on <a href=""https://github.com/moby/moby"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Github</a>. See Docker's <a href=""https://www.docker.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">official website</a> for details.</p>
<p>For a docker installation on different operating systems such as Linux, Windows, or OS X, details can be found <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>; from this site, information about Docker under Windows, Mac or Linux distributions can be accessed. On Windows and OS-X, docker runs in some variety of VM.</p>
<p>Releases have three types: stable, edge and test.

<h1>Where to ask</h1>
<p>Questions on Stack Overflow must be programming-related; see the extended description in the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic"">help center</a> for more details.  Questions about using Docker as a live development environment, mechanics of the Dockerfile system, and other questions that clearly involve application source code are generally welcome.</p>
<p>Questions about installing Docker or running prebuilt images are typically not programming-oriented and are not on-topic for Stack Overflow.  Consider asking these questions on <a href=""https://superuser.com"">Super User</a>, or a site more specific to your host operating system (<a href=""https://askubuntu.com"">Ask Ubuntu</a>, <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com"">Unix &amp; Linux</a>, <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com"">Raspberry Pi Stack Exchange</a>, <a href=""https://apple.stackexchange.com"">Ask Different</a> for MacOS).  Questions about using a Linux distribution package manager such as <code>apt-get</code> or <code>apk</code> are similarly not appropriate for Stack Overflow, even if they are otherwise in the context of a Dockerfile.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixing up an old commit</li>
<li>Reducing repository size by removing large files previously checked into the repo - they still take up disk space even if removed from later commits</li>
<li>Removing sensitive data (passwords, credentials, etc) which you wouldn't want to share when sharing the repo, or even just moving a repo to an external hosting provider</li>
<li>Re-arranging or removing entire folders to reflect the splitting up of many sub-projects from one repo to many, or vice-versa</li>
</ul>

<p>Git repositories store the whole of project history, and by design Git commits are immutable (their id changes completely if even a small part of their content or history is changed) - so how can you remove unwanted data stored deep in your repositoryâs past?</p>

<h2>Tools for rewriting history</h2>

<p><em>Changing</em> history in a Git repository means <em>rewriting</em> all of the subsequent commit history from that point. There are several tools available to let you do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit"" rel=""nofollow""><code>git commit --amend</code></a> - for fixing the most recent commit you just made.</li>
<li><a href=""http://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase"" rel=""nofollow""><code>git rebase</code></a> to <em>rebase</em> a branch's history, replaying it to look as though it was all based on a different (often newer) point in the repository's history. Used with the <code>-i</code> flag, can be used to interactively re-order history.</li>
<li><a href=""http://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch"" rel=""nofollow""><code>git filter-branch</code></a> - an automated tool to rewrite many commits (on many branches) using one or more shell-scripts to make the alterations, which gives it great flexibility.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Sharing the rewritten history</h2>

<p>If a repository has been shared prior to the rewrite, it's necessary to afterwards push the rewritten version to the main server with a <code>--force</code> or <code>--mirror</code> flag, and then request other users to re-clone the repository.</p>

<hr>

<p>In computer architecture, a branch predictor is a digital circuit that tries to guess which way a branch (e.g. an if-then-else structure) will go before this is known for sure. The purpose of the branch predictor is to improve the flow in the instruction pipeline.</p>

<p>Branch predictors play a critical role in achieving high effective performance in many modern pipelined microprocessor architectures such as x86.</p>

<p>Two-way branching is usually implemented with a conditional jump instruction. A conditional jump can either be ""not taken"" and continue execution with the first branch of code which follows immediately after the conditional jump - or it can be ""taken"" and jump to a different place in program memory where the second branch of code is stored.</p>

<p>It is not known for certain whether a conditional jump will be taken or not taken until the condition has been calculated and the conditional jump has passed the execution stage in the instruction pipeline.</p>

<p>Without branch prediction, the processor would have to wait until the conditional jump instruction has passed the execute stage before the next instruction can enter the fetch stage in the pipeline. The branch predictor attempts to avoid this waste of time by trying to guess whether the conditional jump is most likely to be taken or not taken. The branch that is guessed to be the most likely is then fetched and speculatively executed. If it is later detected that the guess was wrong then the speculatively executed or partially executed instructions are discarded and the pipeline starts over with the correct branch, incurring a delay.</p>

<p>The time that is wasted in case of a branch misprediction is equal to the number of stages in the pipeline from the fetch stage to the execute stage. Modern microprocessors tend to have quite long pipelines so that the misprediction delay is between 10 and 20 clock cycles. The longer the pipeline the greater the need for a good branch predictor.</p>

<p><strong>Special-purpose predictors: Return Address Stack for call/ret</strong>.  <code>ret</code> is effectively an indirect branch, setting program-counter = return address.  This would be hard to predict on its own, but calls are normally made with a special instruction so modern CPUs can match call/ret pairs with an internal stack.</p>

After fetching one block, you need to know which block to fetch next, before (or at best in parallel with) decoding the block you just fetched.  A large sequence of <code>jmp next_instruction</code> will overwhelm branch prediction and expose the cost of misprediction in this part of the pipeline.  (Many high-end modern CPUs have a queue after fetch before decode, to hide bubbles, so some blocks of non-branchy code can allow the queue to refill.)</li>

<p><strong>Modern TAGE predictors (in Intel CPUs for example) can ""learn"" amazingly long patterns</strong>, because they index based on past branch history.  (So the same branch can get different predictions depending on the path leading up to it.  A single branch can have its prediction data scattered over many bits in the branch predictor table).  This goes a long way to solving the problem of indirect branches in an interpreter almost always mispredicting (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46321531/x86-prefetching-optimizations-computed-goto-threaded-code"">X86 prefetching optimizations: &quot;computed goto&quot; threaded code</a> and <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7054191"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Branch prediction and the performance of interpreters â Don't trust folklore</a>), or for example a binary search on the same data with the same input can be really efficient.</p>

<h2>Branchless code: using <code>cmov</code> or other tricks to avoid branches</h2>

<p>This is the asm equivalent of replacing <code>if (c) a=b;</code> with <code>a = c ? b : a;</code>.  If <code>b</code> doesn't have side-effects, and <code>a</code> isn't a potentially-shared memory location, compilers can do ""if-conversion"" to do the conditional with a data dependency on <code>c</code> instead of a control dependency.</p>

<p>(C compilers can't introduce a non-atomic read/write: that could step on another thread's modification of the variable.  Writing your code as always rewriting a value tells compilers that it's safe, which sometimes enables auto-vectorization: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47481762/avx-512-and-branching"">AVX-512 and Branching</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Potential downside to <code>cmov</code> in scalar code</strong>: the data dependency can become part of a loop-carried dependency chain and become a bottleneck, while branch prediction + speculative execution hide the latency of control dependencies.

<hr>

<p>From the official <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a> on Python classes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.</p>
  
  <p>[...] Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.</p>
  
  <p>In C++ terminology, normally class members (including the data members) are public (except see below Private Variables), and all member functions are virtual. As in Modula-3, there are no shorthands for referencing the objectâs members from its methods: the method function is declared with an explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call. As in Smalltalk, classes themselves are objects. This provides semantics for importing and renaming. Unlike C++ and Modula-3, built-in types can be used as base classes for extension by the user. Also, like in C++, most built-in operators with special syntax (arithmetic operators, subscripting etc.) can be redefined for class instances.</p>
